* ''Autoritätsdusel ist der größte Feind der Wahrheit.''
** Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
** Letter to Jost Winteler (1901), quoted in ''The Private Lives of Albert Einstein'' by Roger Highfield and Paul Carter (1993), [http://books.google.com/books?id=zY7FE9ZyDO0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 79]. Einstein had been annoyed that Paul Drude, editor of ''Annalen der Physik'', had dismissed out of hand some criticisms Einstein made of Drude's electron theory of metals.

* ''Lieber Habicht! / Es herrscht ein weihevolles Stillschweigen zwischen uns, so daß es mir fast wie eine sündige Entweihung vorkommt, wenn ich es jetzt durch ein wenig bedeutsames Gepappel unterbreche... / Was machen Sie denn, Sie eingefrorener Walfisch, Sie getrocknetes, eingebüchstes Stück Seele...?''

* '''E = mc²'''
** The equivalence of mass and energy was originally expressed by the equation '''m&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;L/c²''', which easily translates into the far more well known '''E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;mc²''' in ''[http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/www/ Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?]'' published in the ''Annalen der Physik'' (27 September 1905) : &quot;If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c².&quot;
** In a later statement explaining the ideas expressed by this equation, Einstein summarized: '''&quot;It followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing — a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind. Furthermore, the equation E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;mc², in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied by the square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were in fact equivalent, according to the formula mentioned before. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally.&quot;'''

* '''How does it happen that a properly endowed natural scientist comes to concern himself with [[wikipedia:Epistemology|epistemology]]?''' Is there not some more valuable work to be done in his specialty? That's what I hear many of my colleagues ask, and I sense it from many more. But I cannot share this sentiment. When I think about the ablest students whom I have encountered in my teaching — that is, those who distinguish themselves by their independence of judgment and not just their quick-wittedness — I can affirm that they had a vigorous interest in epistemology. They happily began discussions about the goals and methods of science, and they showed unequivocally, through tenacious defense of their views, that the subject seemed important to them.&lt;br /&gt; '''Concepts that have proven useful in ordering things easily achieve such authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable givens.''' [''Begriffe, welche sich bei der Ordnung der Dinge als nützlich erwiesen haben, erlangen über uns leicht eine solche Autorität, dass wir ihres irdischen Ursprungs vergessen und sie als unabänderliche Gegebenheiten hinnehmen.''] Thus they might come to be stamped as &quot;necessities of thought,&quot; &quot;a priori givens,&quot; etc. The path of scientific progress is often made impassable for a long time by such errors. [''Der Weg des wissenschaftlichen Fortschritts wird durch solche Irrtümer oft für längere Zeit ungangbar gemacht''.] '''Therefore it is by no means an idle game if we become practiced in analysing long-held commonplace concepts and showing the circumstances on which their justification and usefulness depend, and how they have grown up, individually, out of the givens of experience. Thus their excessive authority will be broken.''' They will be removed if they cannot be properly legitimated, corrected if their correlation with given things be far too superfluous, or replaced if a new system can be established that we prefer for whatever reason.

* &quot;The physical world is real.&quot; That is supposed to be the fundamental hypothesis. What does &quot;hypothesis&quot; mean here? For me, a hypothesis is a statement, whose truth must be assumed for the moment, but whose meaning must be raised above all ambiguity. The above statement appears to me, however, to be, in itself, meaningless, as if one said: &quot;The physical world is cock-a-doodle-do.&quot; It appears to me that the &quot;real&quot; is an intrinsically empty, meaningless category (pigeon hole), whose monstrous importance lies only in the fact that I can do certain things in it and not certain others.
** Letter to Eduard Study, 25 Sept. 1918, in the Einstein Archive, Hebrew U., Jerusalem; translation in D. Howard, ''Perspectives on Science'' '''1''', 225 (1993).

: &lt;small&gt;[http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~yymao/misc/Einstein_PlanckBirthday.html Address at the Physical Society, Berlin, for Max Planck's 60th birthday]&lt;/small&gt;
* '''In the temple of science are many mansions, and various indeed are they that dwell therein and the motives that have led them thither.''' Many take to science out of a joyful sense of superior intellectual power; science is their own special sport to which they look for vivid experience and the satisfaction of ambition; many others are to be found in the temple who have offered the products of their brains on this altar for purely utilitarian purposes. '''Were an angel of the Lord to come and drive all the people belonging to these two categories out of the temple, the assemblage would be seriously depleted, but there would still be some men, of both present and past times, left inside. Our [[Max Planck|Planck]] is one of them, and that is why we love him.'''&lt;br /&gt; I am quite aware that we have just now lightheartedly expelled in imagination many excellent men who are largely, perhaps chiefly, responsible for the buildings of the temple of science; and in many cases our angel would find it a pretty ticklish job to decide. But of one thing I feel sure: if the types we have just expelled were the only types there were, the temple would never have come to be, any more than a forest can grow which consists of nothing but creepers. For these people any sphere of human activity will do, if it comes to a point; whether they become engineers, officers, tradesmen, or scientists depends on circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;Now let us have another look at those who have found favor with the angel. '''Most of them are somewhat odd, uncommunicative, solitary fellows, really less like each other, in spite of these common characteristics, than the hosts of the rejected. What has brought them to the temple? That is a difficult question and no single answer will cover it.'''

* '''The state of mind which enables a man to do work of this kind is akin to that of the religious worshiper or the lover; the daily effort comes from no deliberate intention or program, but straight from the heart.'''

* '''Man tries to make for himself in the fashion that suits him best a simplified and intelligible picture of the world; he then tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his for the world of experience, and thus to overcome it. This is what the painter, the poet, the speculative philosopher, and the natural scientist do, each in his own fashion.''' Each makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life, in order to find in this way the peace and security which he cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience.
** Variant translation: One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought. With this negative motive goes a positive one. '''Man seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. This is what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the natural scientist, each in his own way. Into this image and its formation, he places the center of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the peace and serenity that he cannot find within the narrow confines of swirling personal experience.'''
** As quoted in ''The Professor, the Institute, and DNA'' (1976) by Rene Dubos; also in ''The Great Influenza'' (2004) by John M. Barry

* '''The supreme task of the physicist is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them.''' In this methodological uncertainty, one might suppose that there were any number of possible systems of theoretical physics all equally well justified; and this opinion is no doubt correct, theoretically. But the development of physics has shown that at any given moment, out of all conceivable constructions, a single one has always proved itself decidedly superior to all the rest.
** Variant, from Preface to [[Max Planck]]'s ''Where is Science Going?'' (1933): The supreme task of the physicist is the discovery of the most general elementary laws from which the world-picture can be deduced logically. But there is no logical way to the discovery of these elemental laws. There is only the way of intuition, which is helped by a feeling for the order lying behind the appearance, and this ''Einfühlung'' [literally, empathy or 'feeling one's way in']' is developed by experience.

* We may assume the existence of an aether; only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it, i.e. we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz had still left it. … But this ether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable inedia, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.

*** Originally said to Princeton University mathematics professor Oscar Veblen, May 1921, while Einstein was in Princeton for a series of lectures, upon hearing that an experimental result by Dayton C. Miller of Cleveland, if true, would contradict his theory of gravitation. But the claimed discrepancy was quite small and required special circumstances (hence Einsteins's remark). The result turned out to be false. Some say by this remark Einstein meant that Nature hides her secrets by being subtle, while others say he meant that nature is mischievous but not bent on trickery.

* How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality? Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things?

* One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.

* The meaning of relativity has been widely misunderstood. Philosophers play with the word, like a child with a doll. Relativity, as I see it, merely denotes that certain physical and mechanical facts, which have been regarded as positive and permanent, are relative with regard to certain other facts in the sphere of physics and mechanics. It does not mean that everything in life is relative and that we have the right to turn the whole world mischievously topsy-turvy.

* No man can [[Visualization|visualize]] four dimensions, except mathematically … I think in four dimensions, but only abstractly. The human mind can picture these dimensions no more than it can envisage electricity. Nevertheless, they are no less real than electro-magnetism, the force which controls our universe, within, and by which we have our being.

* Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.
** Quoted in ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein'' by Alice Calaprice (2010), p. 230

* I refuse to make money out of my science. My laurel is not for sale like so many bales of cotton.

* '''If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. … I cannot tell if I would have done any creative work of importance in music, but I do know that I get most joy in life out of my violin.'''

* '''Reading after a certain age diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking''', just as the man who spends too much time in the theater is tempted to be content with living vicariously instead of living his own life.

* Our time is Gothic in its spirit. Unlike the Renaissance, it is not dominated by a few outstanding personalities. The twentieth century has established the democracy of the intellect. In the republic of art and science there are many men who take an equally important part in the intellectual movements of our age. It is the epoch rather than the individual that is important. There is no one dominant personality like Galileo or Newton. Even in the nineteenth century there were still a few giants who outtopped all others. Today the general level is much higher than ever before in the history of the world, but there are few men whose stature immediately sets them apart from all others.

* In America, more than anywhere else, the individual is lost in the achievements of the many. America is beginning to be the world leader in scientific investigation. American scholarship is both patient and inspiring. The Americans show an unselfish devotion to science, which is the very opposite of the conventional European view of your countrymen. '''Too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers. This is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves.''' It is not true that the dollar is an American fetish. The American student is not interested in dollars, not even in success as such, but in his task, the object of the search. It is his painstaking application to the study of the infinitely little and the infinitely large which accounts for his success in astronomy.

* We are inclined to overemphasize the material influences in history. The Russians especially make this mistake. Intellectual values and ethnic influences, tradition and emotional factors are equally important. If this were not the case, Europe would today be a federated state, not a madhouse of nationalism.

* I am a determinist. As such, I do not believe in free will. The Jews believe in free will. They believe that man shapes his own life. I reject that doctrine philosophically. In that respect I am not a Jew.
** Quoted in ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=dJMpQagbz_gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Einstein: His Life and Universe]'' by Walter Isaacson, p. 387

* I believe with [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]: We can do what we wish, but we can only wish what we must. Practically, I am, nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being. I know that philosophically a murderer is not responsible for his crime; nevertheless, I must protect myself from unpleasant contacts. I may consider him guiltless, but I prefer not to take tea with him.

* My own career was undoubtedly determined, not by my own will but by various factors over which I have no control—primarily those mysterious glands in which Nature prepares the very essence of life, our internal secretions.

* Whereas materialistic historians and philosophers neglect psychic realities, Freud is inclined to overstress their importance. I am not a psychologist, but it seems to me fairly evident that physiological factors, especially our endocrines, control our destiny … I am not able to venture a judgment on so important a phase of modern thought. However, it seems to me that psychoanalysis is not always salutary. It may not always be helpful to delve into the subconscious. The machinery of our legs is controlled by a hundred different muscles. Do you think it would help us to walk if we analyzed our legs and knew exactly which one of the little muscles must be employed in locomotion and the order in which they work? … I am not prepared to accept all his [Freud's] conclusions, but I consider his work an immensely valuable contribution to the science of human behavior. I think he is even greater as a writer than as a psychologist. Freud's brilliant style is unsurpassed by anyone since Schopenhauer.

* The only progress I can see is progress in organization. The ordinary human being does not live long enough to draw any substantial benefit from his own experience. And no one, it seems, can benefit by the experiences of others. Being both a father and teacher, I know we can teach our children nothing. We can transmit to them neither our knowledge of life nor of mathematics. Each must learn its lesson anew.

* '''I believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am.''' When two expeditions of scientists, financed by the Royal Academy, went forth to test my theory of relativity, I was convinced that their conclusions would tally with my hypothesis. I was not surprised when the eclipse of May 29, 1919, confirmed my intuitions. I would have been surprised if I had been wrong.

* '''I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.'''

* '''As a child, I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.'''

* Jesus is too colossal for the pen of phrasemongers, however artful. No man can dispose of Christianity with a ''bon mot''.

* '''No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.'''
** As reported in ''Einstein — A Life'' (1996) by Denis Brian, when asked about a clipping from a magazine article reporting his comments on Christianity as taken down by Viereck, Einstein carefully read the clipping and replied, '''&quot;That is what I believe.&quot;''' .

* It is quite possible to be both. I look upon myself as a man. '''Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.'''
** When asked by Viereck if he considered himself to be a German or a Jew. A version with slightly different wording is quoted in [http://books.google.com/books?id=dJMpQagbz_gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA386#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Einstein: His Life and Universe] by Walter Isaacson (2007), p. 386

* We Jews have been too adaptable. We have been too eager to sacrifice our idiosyncrasies for the sake of social conformity. … Even in modern civilization, the Jew is most happy if he remains a Jew.

* I do not think that religion is the most important element. We are held together rather by a body of tradition, handed down from father to son, which the child imbibes with his mother's milk. The atmosphere of our infancy predetermines our idiosyncrasies and predilections.
** In response to a question about whether religion is the tie holding the Jews together.

* But to return to the Jewish question. Other groups and nations cultivate their individual traditions. There is no reason why we should sacrifice ours. '''Standardization robs life of its spice.''' To deprive every ethnic group of its special traditions is to convert the world into a huge Ford plant. '''I believe in standardizing automobiles. I do not believe in standardizing human beings.''' Standardization is a great peril which threatens American culture.

* I am happy because I want nothing from anyone. I do not care for money. Decorations, titles or distinctions mean nothing to me. I do not crave praise. The only thing that gives me pleasure, apart from my work, my violin and my sailboat, is the appreciation of my fellow workers.

* I claim credit for nothing. Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible player.

* '''I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God.''' We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.

* The scientific organization and comprehensive exposition in accessible form of the Talmud has a twofold importance for us Jews. It is important in the first place that the high cultural values of the Talmud should not be lost to modern minds among the Jewish people nor to science, but should operate further as a living force. In the second place, The Talmud must be made an open book to the world, in order to cut the ground from under certain malevolent attacks, of anti-Semitic origin, which borrow countenance from the obscurity and inaccessibility of certain passages in the Talmud.  To support this cultural work would thus mean an important achievement for the Jewish people.

* '''Why does this magnificent applied science which saves work and makes life easier bring us so little happiness? The simple answer runs: Because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it.''' In war it serves that we may poison and mutilate each other. In peace it has made our lives hurried and uncertain. Instead of freeing us in great measure from spiritually exhausting labor, it has made men into slaves of machinery, who for the most part complete their monotonous long day's work with disgust and must continually tremble for their poor rations. … It is not enough that you should understand about applied science in order that your work may increase man's blessings. Concern for the man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavours; concern for the great unsolved problems of the organization of labor and the distribution of goods in order that the creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.

* '''Our experience hitherto justifies us in trusting that nature is the realization of the simplest that is mathematically conceivable.''' I am convinced that purely mathematical construction enables us to find those concepts and those lawlike connections between them that provide the key to the understanding of natural phenomena. Useful mathematical concepts may well be suggested by experience, but in no way can they be derived from it. Experience naturally remains the sole criterion of the usefulness of a mathematical construction for physics. But the actual creative principle lies in mathematics. Thus, in a certain sense, '''I take it to be true that pure thought can grasp the real, as the ancients had dreamed.'''

** There is a quote attributed to Einstein that may have arisen as a paraphrase of the above quote, commonly given as “'''Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler,'''” &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;, or “Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.” See [http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/ this article from the Quote Investigator] for a discussion of where these later variants may have arisen.
** The original quote is very similar to [[wikipedia: Occam's razor|Occam's razor]], which advocates that among all hypotheses compatible with all available observations, the simplest hypothesis is the most plausible one.
** The aphorism &quot;everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler&quot; is normally taken to be a warning against too much simplicity and emphasizes that one cannot simplify things to a point where the hypothesis is no more compatible with all observations. The aphorism does not contradict or extend Occam's razor, but rather stresses that both elements of the razor, simplicity and compatibility with the observations, are essential.
** The earliest known appearance of Einstein's razor is an essay by Roger Sessions in the ''New York Times'' (8 January 1950)[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30615FE3559137A93CAA9178AD85F448585F9], where Sessions appears to be paraphrasing Einstein: “I also remember a remark of Albert Einstein, which certainly applies to music. He said, in effect, that everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler.”
** Another early appearance, from ''Time'' magazine (14 December 1962)[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872923,00.html]: “We try to keep in mind a saying attributed to Einstein—that everything must be made as simple as possible, but not one bit simpler.”

* In light of knowledge obtained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble.

* It has often been said, and certainly not without justification, that the man of science is a poor philosopher. Why then should it not be the right thing for the physicist to let the philosopher do the philosophizing? Such might indeed be the right thing to do at a time when the physicist believes he has at his disposal a rigid system of fundamental laws which are so well established that waves of doubt can't reach them; but it cannot be right at a time when the very foundations of physics itself have become problematic as they are now. At a time like the present, when experience forces us to seek a newer and more solid foundation, the physicist cannot simply surrender to the philosopher the critical contemplation of theoretical foundations; for he himself knows best and feels more surely where the shoe pinches. In looking for an new foundation, he must try to make clear in his own mind just how far the concepts which he uses are justified, and are necessities.

* '''All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom.''' It is no mere chance that our older universities developed from clerical schools. Both churches and universities — insofar as they live up to their true function — serve the ennoblement of the individual. They seek to fulfill this great task by spreading moral and cultural understanding, renouncing the use of brute force. &lt;br /&gt; The essential unity of ecclesiastical and secular institutions was lost during the 19th century, to the point of senseless hostility. Yet there was never any doubt as to the striving for culture. No one doubted the sacredness of the goal. It was the approach that was disputed.

* '''Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world.''' In our endeavor to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way of opening the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all the things he observes, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. '''He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison.''' But he certainly believes that, as his knowledge increases, his picture of reality will become simpler and simpler and will explain a wider and wider range of his sensuous impressions. '''He may also believe in the existence of the ideal limit of knowledge and that it is approached by the human mind. He may call this ideal limit the objective truth.'''

* Fundamental ideas play the most essential role in forming a physical theory. Books on physics are full of complicated mathematical formulae. But thought and ideas, not formulae, are the beginning of every physical theory. The ideas must later take the mathematical form of a quantitative theory, to make possible the comparison with experiment.
** ''The Evolution of Physics'' (1938) (co-written with [[Leopold Infeld]]) &lt;!-- later published by Simon &amp; Schuster (1967) --&gt;

* The moral decline we are compelled to witness and the suffering it engenders are so oppressive that one cannot ignore them even for a moment. No matter how deeply one immerses oneself in work, a haunting feeling of inescapable tragedy persists. '''Still, there are moments when one feels free from one's own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.'''

* The standard bearers have grown weak in the defense of their priceless heritage, and the powers of darkness have been strengthened thereby.

* Some recent work by E. Fermi and [[wikipedia:Leo Szilard|L.

Certain aspects of the situation seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration...  This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat or exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.

==== Wisehart interview (1930) ====
* Every man knows that in his work he does best and accomplishes most when he has attained a proficiency that enables him to work intuitively. That is, there are things which we come to know so well that we do not know how we know them. So it seems to me in matters of principle. Perhaps we live best and do things best when we are not too conscious of how and why we do them.

* I do not believe in a God who maliciously or arbitrarily interferes in the personal affairs of mankind. '''My religion consists of an humble admiration for the vast power which manifests itself in that small part of the universe which our poor, weak minds can grasp!'''

* '''Much reading after a certain age diverts the mind from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking,''' just as the man who spends too much time in the theaters is apt to be content with living vicariously instead of living his own life.

[[File:Saint_francis042.jpg|thumb|We find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest [[religious]] experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as [[atheists]], but sometimes also as [[saints]].

* '''Everything that men do or think concerns the satisfaction of the needs they feel or the escape from pain.''' This must be kept in mind when we seek to understand spiritual or intellectual movements and the way in which they develop. For feelings and longings are the motive forces of all human striving and productivity—however nobly these latter may display themselves to us.
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': '''Everything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the satisfaction of deeply felt needs and the assuagement of pain.''' One has to keep this constantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and their development. Feeling and longing are the motive force behind all human endeavor and human creation, in however exalted a guise the latter may present themselves to us.

* The longing for guidance, for love and succor, provides the stimulus for the growth of a social or moral conception of God. This is the God of Providence, who protects, decides, rewards and punishes. This is the God who, according to man's widening horizon, loves and provides for the life of the race, or of mankind, or who even loves life itself. He is the comforter in unhappiness and in unsatisfied longing, the protector of the souls of the dead. This is the social or moral idea of God.
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God. This is the God of Providence, who protects, disposes, rewards, and punishes; the God who, according to the limits of the believer's outlook, loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or of the human race, or even of life itself; the comforter in sorrow and unsatisfied longing; he who preserves the souls of the dead. This is the social or moral conception of God.

* It is easy to follow in the sacred writings of the Jewish people the development of the religion of fear into the moral religion, which is carried further in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially those of the Orient, are principally moral religions. '''An important advance in the life of a people is the transformation of the religion of fear into the moral religion. But one must avoid the prejudice that regards the religions of primitive peoples as pure fear religions and those of the civilized races as pure moral religions. All are mixed forms, though the moral element predominates in the higher levels of social life.'''
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. '''The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples' lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates.'''

* Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of the idea of God. Only exceptionally gifted individuals or especially noble communities rise ''essentially'' above this level; in these there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. '''This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought.''' He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance. Indications of this cosmic religious sense can be found even on earlier levels of development—for example, in the Psalms of David and in the Prophets. The cosmic element is much stronger in Buddhism, as, in particular, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s magnificent essays have shown us. '''The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man's image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints. Viewed from this angle, men like [[Democritus]], [[Francis of Assisi]], and [[Spinoza]] are near to one another.'''
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. In general, only individuals of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded communities, rise to any considerable extent above this level. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. '''It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it. The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought.''' Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this. '''The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another.'''

* '''How can this cosmic religious experience be communicated from man to man, if it cannot lead to a definite conception of God or to a theology? It seems to me that the most important function of art and of science is to arouse and keep alive this feeling in those who are receptive.'''
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': '''How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.'''

* For any one who is pervaded with the sense of causal law in all that happens, who accepts in real earnest the assumption of causality, the idea of Being who interferes with the sequence of events in the world is absolutely impossible. Neither the religion of fear nor the social-moral religion can have any hold on him. A God who rewards and punishes is for him unthinkable, because man acts in accordance with an inner and outer necessity, and would, in the eyes of God, be as little responsible as an inanimate object is for the movements which it makes. '''Science, in consequence, has been accused of undermining morals—but wrongly. The ethical behavior of man is better based on sympathy, education and social relationships, and requires no support from religion. Man's plight would, indeed, be sad if he had to be kept in order through fear of punishment and hope of rewards after death.'''
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events — provided, of course, that he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes. '''Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death.'''
** Variant: &quot;It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere&quot; has been [http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/einstein.htm cited] as a statement that precedes the last three sentences here, but in fact this is a separate quote from a 1947 letter Einstein wrote to Murray W. Gross, included in the [[Albert Einstein#Einstein and Religion .281999.29|Einstein and Religion (1999)]] section below (and in the letter the word used is &quot;anthropomorphic,&quot; not &quot;anthropological&quot;).

* It is, therefore, quite natural that the churches have always fought against science and have persecuted its supporters. But, on the other hand, '''I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and noblest driving force behind scientific research.''' No one who does not appreciate the terrific exertions, and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer creations in scientific thought cannot come into being, can judge the strength of the feeling out of which alone such work, turned away as it is from immediate practical life, can grow. What a '''deep faith in the rationality of the structure of the world''' and what a longing to understand even a small glimpse of the reason revealed in the world there must have been in [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to enable them to unravel the mechanism of the heavens in long years of lonely work! '''Any one who only knows scientific research in its practical applications may easily come to a wrong interpretation of the state of mind of the men who, surrounded by skeptical contemporaries, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered over all countries in all centuries.''' Only those who have dedicated their lives to similar ends can have a living conception of the inspiration which gave these men the power to remain loyal to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is the cosmic religious sense which grants this power. A contemporary has rightly said that the only deeply religious people of our largely materialistic age are the earnest men of research.
** Wording in ''Ideas and Opinions'': It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees. On the other hand, '''I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research.''' Only those who realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer work in theoretical science cannot be achieved are able to grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue. What a '''deep conviction of the rationality of the universe''' and what a yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to spend years of solitary labor in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics! '''Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries.''' Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people.

* '''How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it.''' But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people — first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. '''A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...''' .

* I am strongly drawn to the simple life and am often oppressed by the feeling that I am engrossing an unnecessary amount of the labour of my fellow-men. '''I regard class differences as contrary to justice and, in the last resort, based on force. I also consider that plain living is good for everybody, physically and mentally.'''

* '''In human freedom in the philosophical sense I am definitely a disbeliever. Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity.''' [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s saying, that &quot;'''a man can do as he will, but not will as he will''',&quot; has been an inspiration to me since my youth up, and a continual consolation and unfailing well-spring of patience in the face of the hardships of life, my own and others'. '''This feeling mercifully mitigates the sense of responsibility which so easily becomes paralyzing, and it prevents us from taking ourselves and other people too seriously; it conduces to a view of life in which humor, above all, has its due place.'''

* '''I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves — this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth.''' Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts — possessions, outward success, luxury — have always seemed to me contemptible.

* I gang my own gait and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties I have never lost an obstinate sense of detachment, of the need for solitude — a feeling which increases with the years.

** The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenetrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties — this knowledge, this feeling … that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.

* '''Our situation on this earth seems strange.''' Every one of us appears here involuntarily and uninvited for a short stay, without knowing the whys and the wherefore. In our daily lives we only feel that man is here for the sake of others, for those whom we love and for many other beings whose fate is connected with our own. '''I am often worried at the thought that my life is based to such a large extent on the work of my fellow human beings and I am aware of my great indebtedness to them.'''

* '''I do not believe in freedom of the will. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s words: “Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills” accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of freedom of will preserves me from taking too seriously myself and my fellow men as acting and deciding individuals and from losing my temper.'''

* '''My passion for social justice has often brought me into conflict with people, as has my aversion to any obligation and dependence I did not regard as absolutely necessary.''' &lt;br /&gt; I have a high regard for the individual and an insuperable distaste for violence and fanaticism. All these motives have made me a passionate pacifist and antimilitarist. I am against any chauvinism, even in the guise of mere patriotism. &lt;br /&gt; '''Privileges based on position and property have always seemed to me unjust and pernicious, as does any exaggerated personality cult.

* '''The most beautiful and deepest experience a man can have is the sense of the mysterious. It is the underlying principle of religion as well as all serious endeavor in art and science. He who never had this experience seems to me, if not dead, then at least blind.''' To sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is a something that our mind cannot grasp and whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly and as a feeble reflection, this is religiousness. &lt;br /&gt; In this sense I am religious. To me it suffices to wonder at these secrets and to attempt humbly to grasp with my mind a mere image of the lofty structure of all that there is.

* The efforts of most human-beings are consumed in the struggle for their daily bread, but most of those who are, either through fortune or some special gift, relieved of this struggle are largely absorbed in further improving their worldly lot. '''Beneath the effort directed toward the accumulation of worldly goods lies all too frequently the illusion that this is the most substantial and desirable end to be achieved; but there is, fortunately, a minority composed of those who recognize early in their lives that the most beautiful and satisfying experiences open to humankind are not derived from the outside, but are bound up with the development of the individual's own feeling, thinking and acting.''' The genuine artists, investigators and thinkers have always been persons of this kind. However inconspicuously the life of these individuals runs its course, none the less the fruits of their endeavors are the most valuable contributions which one generation can make to its successors.

* '''In the judgment of the most competent living mathematicians, Fräulein Noether was the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began.'''

* A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.
** From [https://web.archive.org/web/20140622171150/http://www.turnthetide.info/id54.htm &quot;Atomic Education Urged by Einstein&quot;], ''New York Times'' (25 May 1946), and later quoted in the article &quot;The Real Problem is in the Hearts of Man&quot; by Michael Amrine, from the ''New York Times Magazine'' (23 June 1946). A slightly modified version of the 23 June article was reprinted in ''Einstein on Peace'' by Otto Nathan and Heinz Norden (1960), and it was also reprinted in ''Einstein on Politics'' by David E. Rowe and Robert Schulmann (2007), p. 383.
** In ''The New Quotable Einstein'' (2005), editor Alice Calaprice suggests that two quotes attributed to Einstein which she could not find sources for, &quot;The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them&quot; and &quot;The world we have created today as a result of our thinking thus far has problems which cannot be solved by thinking the way we thought when we created them,&quot; may both be paraphrases of the 1946 quote above. A similar unsourced variant is &quot;The world we have created is a product of our thinking; it cannot be changed without changing our thinking.&quot;
** In the 23 June article Einstein expanded somewhat on the original quote from the 25 May article:
**: Many persons have inquired concerning a recent message of mine that &quot;a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move to higher levels.&quot;
**: Often in evolutionary processes a species must adapt to new conditions in order to survive. Today the atomic bomb has altered profoundly the nature of the world as we knew it, and the human race consequently finds itself in a new habitat to which it must adapt its thinking.
**: In the light of new knowledge, a world authority and an eventual world state are not just ''desirable'' in the name of brotherhood, they are ''necessary'' for survival. In previous ages a nation's life and culture could be protected to some extent by the growth of armies in national competition. Today we must abandon competition and secure cooperation. This must be the central fact in all our considerations of international affairs; otherwise we face certain disaster. '''Past thinking and methods did not prevent world wars. Future thinking ''must'' prevent wars.'''

* I just want to explain what I mean when I say that we should try to hold on to physical reality. &lt;br /&gt; We are … all aware of the situation regarding what will turn out to be the basic foundational concepts in physics: the point-mass or the particle is surely not among them; the field, in the Faraday-Maxwell sense, might be, but not with certainty. But that which we conceive as existing (&quot;real&quot;) should somehow be localized in time and space. That is, the real in one part of space, ''A'', should (in theory) somehow &quot;exist&quot; independently of that which is thought of as real in another part of space, ''B''. If a physical system stretches over ''A'' and ''B'', then what is present in ''B'' should somehow have an existence independent of what is present in ''A''. What is actually present in ''B'' should thus not depend the type of measurement carried out in the part of space ''A''; it should also be independent of whether or not a measurement is made in ''A''. &lt;br /&gt; If one adheres to this program, then one can hardly view the quantum-theoretical description as a complete representation of the physically real. If one attempts, nevertheless, so to view it, then one must assume that the physically real in ''B'' undergoes a sudden change because of a measurement in ''A''. My physical instincts bristle at that suggestion. &lt;br /&gt; However, if one renounces the assumption that what is present in different parts of space has an independent, real existence, then I don't see at all what physics is supposed to be describing. For '''what is thought to be a &quot;system&quot; is after all, just conventional, and I do not see how one is supposed to divide up the world objectively so that one can make statements about parts.'''

* The reciprocal relationship of epistemology and science is of noteworthy kind. They are dependent on each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is — insofar as it is thinkable at all — primitive and muddled. However, no sooner has the epistemologist, who is seeking a clear system, fought his way through to such a system, than he is inclined to interpret the thought-content of science in the sense of his system and to reject whatever does not fit into his system. The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far. He accepts gratefully the epistemological conceptual analysis; but the external conditions, which are set for him by the facts of experience, do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted in the construction of his conceptual world by the adherence to an epistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist: he appears as ''realist'' insofar as he seeks to describe a world independent of the acts of perception; as ''idealist'' insofar as he looks upon the concepts and theories as free inventions of the human spirit (not logically derivable from what is empirically given); as ''positivist'' insofar as he considers his concepts and theories justified ''only'' to the extent to which they furnish a logical representation of relations among sensory experiences. He may even appear as ''Platonist'' or ''Pythagorean'' insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensible and effective tool of his research.

* '''It would not be difficult to come to an agreement as to what we understand by science. Science is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thoroughgoing an association as possible.''' To put it boldly, it is the attempt at the posterior reconstruction of existence by the process of conceptualization. '''But when asking myself what religion is I cannot think of the answer so easily. And even after finding an answer which may satisfy me at this particular moment, I still remain convinced that I can never under any circumstances bring together, even to a slight extent, the thoughts of all those who have given this question serious consideration.'''

* '''A person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to which he clings because of their superpersonal value.''' It seems to me that what is important is the force of this superpersonal content and the depth of the conviction concerning its overpowering meaningfulness, regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as religious personalities. '''Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself.''' In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary.

* A conflict arises when a religious community insists on the absolute truthfulness of all statements recorded in the Bible. This means an intervention on the part of religion into the sphere of science; this is where the struggle of the Church against the doctrines of Galileo and Darwin belongs. On the other hand, representatives of science have often made an attempt to arrive at fundamental judgments with respect to values and ends on the basis of scientific method, and in this way have set themselves in opposition to religion. These conflicts have all sprung from fatal errors.

* '''Even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies.''' Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. But '''science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith.''' The situation may be expressed by an image: '''science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.'''&lt;br /&gt; Though I have asserted above that in truth a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist, I must nevertheless qualify this assertion once again on an essential point, with reference to the actual content of historical religions. This qualification has to do with the concept of God. During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man's own image, who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate to influence, the phenomenal world. Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favor by means of magic and prayer. The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes.

* '''Nobody, certainly, will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent, just, and omnibeneficent personal God is able to accord man solace, help, and guidance; also, by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind. But, on the other hand, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history.''' That is, if this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?&lt;br /&gt; '''The main source of the present-day conflicts between the spheres of religion and of science lies in this concept of a personal God.'''

* When the number of factors coming into play in a phenomenological complex is too large, scientific method in most cases fails us. One need only think of the weather, in which case prediction even for a few days ahead is impossible. Nevertheless no one doubts that we are confronted with a causal connection whose causal components are in the main known to us.&lt;br /&gt;Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature.

* The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.&lt;br /&gt; But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.

* If it is one of the goals of religion to liberate mankind as far as possible from the bondage of egocentric cravings, desires, and fears, scientific reasoning can aid religion in yet another sense. Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling of facts, this is not its only aim. It also seeks to reduce the connections discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual elements.&lt;br /&gt;It is in this striving after the rational unification of the manifold that it encounters its greatest successes, even though it is precisely this attempt which causes it to run the greatest risk of falling a prey to illusions. '''But whoever has undergone the intense experience of successful advances made in this domain is moved by profound reverence for the rationality made manifest in existence.''' By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching emancipation from the shackles of personal hopes and desires, and thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward the grandeur of reason incarnate in existence, and which, in its profoundest depths, is inaccessible to man.&lt;br /&gt;This attitude, however, appears to me to be religious, in the highest sense of the word. And so it seems to me that '''science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of life.'''&lt;br /&gt;The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.'''E = mc²'''

[[File:Mahatma_Buddha.jpg|thumb|The [[great]] [[moral]] [[teachers]] of [[humanity]] were, in a way, [[artistic]] [[geniuses]] in the art of [[living]].]]

* '''Does there truly exist an insuperable contradiction between religion and science? Can religion be superseded by science? The answers to these questions have, for centuries, given rise to considerable dispute and, indeed, bitter fighting. Yet, in my own mind there can be no doubt that in both cases a dispassionate consideration can only lead to a negative answer.''' What complicates the solution, however, is the fact that while most people readily agree on what is meant by &quot;science,&quot; they are likely to differ on the meaning of &quot;religion.&quot;

* '''Science, in the immediate, produces knowledge and, indirectly, means of action. It leads to methodical action if definite goals are set up in advance. For the function of setting up goals and passing statements of value transcends its domain.''' While it is true that science, to the extent of its grasp of causative connections, may reach important conclusions as to the compatibility and incompatibility of goals and evaluations, the independent and fundamental definitions regarding goals and values remain beyond science's reach.&lt;br /&gt;As regards religion, on the other hand, one is generally agreed that it deals with goals and evaluations and, in general, with the emotional foundation of human thinking and acting, as far as these are not predetermined by the inalterable hereditary disposition of the human species. '''Religion is concerned with man's attitude toward nature at large, with the establishing of ideals for the individual and communal life, and with mutual human relationship.''' These ideals religion attempts to attain by exerting an educational influence on tradition and through the development and promulgation of certain easily accessible thoughts and narratives (epics and myths) which are apt to influence evaluation and action along the lines of the accepted ideals.

* It is this mythical, or rather this symbolic, content of the religious traditions which is likely to come into conflict with science. This occurs whenever this religious stock of ideas contains dogmatically fixed statements on subjects which belong in the domain of science. Thus, it is of vital importance for the preservation of true religion that such conflicts be avoided when they arise from subjects which, in fact, are not really essential for the pursuance of the religious aims.

* The moral attitudes of a people that is supported by religion need always aim at preserving and promoting the sanity and vitality of the community and its individuals, since otherwise this community is bound to perish. '''A people that were to honor falsehood, defamation, fraud, and murder would be unable, indeed, to subsist for very long.'''

* '''The great moral teachers of humanity were, in a way, artistic geniuses in the art of living.'''

* '''While religion prescribes brotherly love in the relations among the individuals and groups, the actual spectacle more resembles a battlefield than an orchestra.''' Everywhere, in economic as well as in political life, the guiding principle is one of ruthless striving for success at the expense of one's fellow men. This competitive spirit prevails even in school and, destroying all feelings of human fraternity and cooperation, conceives of achievement not as derived from the love for productive and thoughtful work, but as springing from personal ambition and fear of rejection.&lt;br /&gt; '''There are pessimists who hold that such a state of affairs is necessarily inherent in human nature; it is those who propound such views that are the enemies of true religion, for they imply thereby that religious teachings are Utopian ideals and unsuited to afford guidance in human affairs.''' The study of the social patterns in certain so-called primitive cultures, however, seems to have made it sufficiently evident that such a defeatist view is wholly unwarranted.

* While it is true that scientific results are entirely independent from religious or moral considerations, those individuals to whom we owe the great creative achievements of science were all of them imbued with the truly religious conviction that this universe of ours is something perfect and susceptible to the rational striving for knowledge. If this conviction had not been a strongly emotional one and if those searching for knowledge had not been inspired by Spinoza's ''Amor Dei Intellectualis'', they would hardly have been capable of that untiring devotion which alone enables man to attain his greatest achievements.

* Even when I was a fairly precocious young man the nothingness of the hopes and strivings which chases most men restlessly through life came to my consciousness with considerable vitality. Moreover, I soon discovered the cruelty of that chase, which in those years was much more carefully covered up by hypocrisy and glittering words than is the case today. By the mere existence of his stomach everyone was condemned to participate in that chase. Moreover, it was possible to satisfy the stomach by such participation, but not man in so far as he is a thinking and feeling being. As the first way out there was religion, which is implanted into every child by way of the traditional education-machine. '''Thus I came—despite the fact that I was the son of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents—to a deep religiosity, which, however, found an abrupt ending at the age of 12.''' Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic [orgy of] freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression. '''Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude towards the convictions which were alive in any specific social environment—an attitude which has never again left me''', even though later on, because of a better insight into the causal connections, it lost some of its original poignancy.&lt;!-- p. 339-340 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* '''It is quite clear to me that the religious paradise of youth, which was thus lost, was a first attempt to free myself from the chains of the &quot;merely-personal,&quot; from an existence which is dominated by wishes, hopes and primitive feelings.''' Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation, and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner freedom and security in devoted occupation with it. The mental grasp of this extrapersonal world within the frame of the given possibilites swam as highest aim half consciously and half unconsciously before my mind's eye. Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past, as well as the insights which they had achieved, were the friends which could not be lost. '''The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise; but it has proved itself as trustworthy, and I have never regretted having chosen it.'''&lt;!-- 340 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* For me it is not dubious that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously. For how, otherwise, should it happen that sometimes we &quot;wonder&quot; quite spontaneously about some experience? This &quot;wondering&quot; seems to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts which is already sufficiently fixed in us. Whenever such a conflict is experienced hard and intensively it reacts back upon our thought world in a decisive way. The development of this thought world is in a certain sense a continuous flight from &quot;wonder.&quot;&lt;!-- pp. 341-342 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* '''A wonder of such nature I experienced as a child of 4 or 5 years, when my father showed me a compass.''' That this needle behaved in such a determined way did not at all fit into the nature of events, which could find a place in the unconscious world of concepts (effect connected with direct &quot;touch&quot;). I can still remember—or at least believe I can remember—that this experience made a deep and lasting impression upon me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things. What man sees before him from infancy causes no reaction of this kind; he is not surprised over the falling of bodies, concerning wind and rain, nor concerning the moon or about the fact that the moon does not fall down, nor concerning the differences between living and non-living matter.&lt;br /&gt;At the age of 12 I experienced a second wonder of a totally different nature: in a little book dealing with Euclidean plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a schoolyear. Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which—though by no means evident—could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me. That the axioms had to be accepted unproved did not disturb me. In any case it was quite sufficient for me if I could peg proofs upon propositions the validity of which did not seem to me to be dubious.&lt;!-- 342 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* One had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect [upon me] that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year. &lt;!-- p. 346 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.&lt;!-- p. 346 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* ''Eine Theorie ist desto eindrucksvoller, je größer die Einfachheit ihrer Prämissen ist, je verschiedenartigere Dinge sie verknüpft, und je weiter ihr Anwendungsbereich ist.''
** A theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises is, the more different kinds of things it relates, and the more extended is its area of applicability. Therefore the deep impression which classical thermodynamics made upon me. '''It is the only physical theory of universal content concerning which I am convinced that, within the framework of the applicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown''' (for the special attention of those who are skeptics on principle).&lt;!-- 353 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

* Reflections of this type made it clear to me as long ago as shortly after 1900, i.e., shortly after Planck's trailblazing work, that neither mechanics nor electrodynamics could (except in limiting cases) claim exact validity. By and by I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results. . . . How, then, could such a universal principle be found? '''After ten years of reflection such a principle resulted from a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity ''c'' (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest. However, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the bases of experience or according to Maxwell's equations.''' From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the stand-point of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest.&lt;!-- 362-363 of &quot;A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion&quot; --&gt;

=== &quot;Einstein's Reply to Criticisms&quot; (1949) ===
* I now imagine a quantum theoretician who may even admit that the quantum-theoretical description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems, but who, nevertheless, clings to the idea that the type of description of the statistical quantum theory will, in its essential features, be retained in the future. He may argue as follows: True, I admit that the quantum-theoretical description is an incomplete description of the individual system. I even admit that a complete theoretical description is, in principle, thinkable. But I consider it proven that the search for such a complete description would be aimless. For the lawfulness of nature is thus constituted that the laws can be completely and suitably formulated within the framework of our incomplete description.

* To this I can only reply as follows: Your point of view — taken as theoretical possibility — is incontestable. For me, however, the expectation that the adequate formulation of the universal laws involves the use of ''all'' conceptual elements which are necessary for a complete description, is more natural. It is furthermore not at all surprising that, by using an incomplete description, (in the main) only statistical statements can be obtained out of such description. If it should be possible to move forward to a complete description, it is likely that the laws would represent relations among all the conceptual elements of this description which, ''per se'', have nothing to do with statistics.

'''The Meaning of Life'''

* '''What is the [[Meaning of life|meaning of human life]], or of organic life altogether? To answer this question at all implies a religion.''' Is there any sense then, you ask, in putting it? '''I answer, the man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.'''

'''Good and Evil'''

* '''''The true value of a human being'' is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which he has attained to liberation from the self.'''

'''Society and Personality'''

* '''When we survey our lives and endeavors we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings.''' We see that our whole nature resembles that of the social animals. We eat food that others have grown, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been communicated to us by other people through the medium of a language which others have created. Without language our mental capacities would be poor indeed, comparable to those of the higher animals; we have, therefore, to admit that we owe our principal advantage over the beasts to the fact of living in human society. '''The individual, if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly conceive. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a member of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to the grave.'''

[[File:Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg|thumb|The example of [[great]] and [[pure]] characters is the only thing that can produce fine [[ideas]] and [[noble]] [[deeds]].]]
* '''A man's value to the community depends primarily on how far his feelings, thoughts, and actions are directed towards promoting the good of his fellows.''' We call him good or bad according to how he stands in this matter. It looks at first sight as if our estimate of a man depended entirely on his social qualities. &lt;br /&gt; '''And yet such an attitude would be wrong.''' It is clear that all the valuable things, material, spiritual, and moral, which we receive from society can be traced back through countless generations to certain creative individuals. The use of fire, the cultivation of edible plants, the steam engine — each was discovered by one man.&lt;br /&gt; '''Only the individual can think, and thereby create new values for society — nay, even set up new moral standards to which the life of the community conforms. Without creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community.&lt;br /&gt;   The health of society thus depends quite as much on the independence of the individuals composing it as on their close political cohesion.'''

'''Of Wealth'''

* I am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity forward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker in this cause. '''The example of great and pure characters is the only thing that can produce fine ideas and noble deeds.''' Money only appeals to selfishness and always tempts its owners irresistibly to abuse it.&lt;br /&gt; '''Can anyone imagine [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], or [[Gandhi]] armed with the money-bags of [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]]?'''

'''Religion in Science'''

* '''You will hardly find one among the profounder sort of scientific minds without a peculiar religious feeling of his own. But it is different from the religion of the naive man. For the latter God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one stands to some extent in a personal relation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe. But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.''' This feeling is the guiding principle of his life and work, in so far as he succeeds in keeping himself from the shackles of selfish desire. It is beyond question closely akin to that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages.

'''Greeting to G. Bernard Shaw'''

* '''There are few enough people with sufficient independence to see the weaknesses and follies of their contemporaries and remain themselves untouched by them.''' And these isolated few usually soon lose their zeal for putting things to rights when they have come face to face with human obduracy. '''Only to a tiny minority is it given to fascinate their generation by subtle humour and grace and to hold the mirror up to it by the impersonal agency of art. To-day I salute with sincere emotion the supreme master of this method, who has delighted — and educated — us all.'''

'''Some Notes on my American Impressions'''
: first published as &quot;My First Impression of the U.S.A.&quot; (1921)

* The cult of individual personalities is always, in my view, unjustified. To be sure, nature distributes her gifts variously among her children. But there are plenty of the well-endowed ones too, thank God, and I am firmly convinced that most of them live quiet, unregarded lives. It strikes me as unfair, and even in bad taste, to select a few of them for boundless admiration, attributing superhuman powers of mind and character to them. This has been my fate, and the contrast between the popular estimate of my powers and achievements and the reality is simply grotesque. '''The consciousness of this extraordinary state of affairs would be unbearable but for one great consoling thought: it is a welcome symptom in an age which is commonly denounced as materialistic, that it makes heroes of men whose ambitions lie wholly in the intellectual and moral sphere. This proves that knowledge and justice are ranked above wealth and power by a large section of the human race.''' My experience teaches me that this idealistic outlook is particularly prevalent in America, which is usually decried as a particularly materialistic country.

* The United States is the most powerful technically advanced country in the world to-day. Its influence on the shaping of international relations is absolutely incalculable. But America is a large country and its people have so far not shown much interest in great international problems, among which the problem of disarmament occupies first place today. This must be changed, if only in the essential interests of the Americans. The last war has shown that there are no longer any barriers between the continents and that the destinies of all countries are closely interwoven. The people of this country must realize that they have a great responsibility in the sphere of international politics. The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all round.

'''Production and Work'''

* Bureaucracy is the death of all sound work.

[[File:Redentor.jpg|thumb|If one purges the [[Judaism]] of the [[Prophets]] and [[Christianity]] as [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a [[teaching]] which is capable of curing all the [[social]] ills of [[humanity]].]]
'''Christianity and Judaism'''

* '''If one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity. &lt;br /&gt;   It is the duty of every man of good will to strive steadfastly in his own little world to make this teaching of pure humanity a living force, so far as he can.''' If he makes an honest attempt in this direction without being crushed and trampled under foot by his contemporaries, he may consider himself and the community to which he belongs lucky.

'''Unconfirmed:'''
: The following quotes have been cited as being from ''The World As I See It'' but are not in later ''abridged'' editions of the original 1949 book and thus these citations are not yet confirmed.

* May the conscience and the common sense of the peoples be awakened, so that we may reach a new stage in the life of nations, where people will look back on war as an incomprehensible aberration of their forefathers!

* The state is made for man, not man for the state. And in this respect science resembles the state.

* It is not enough to teach a man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. '''He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community.''' These precious things are conveyed to the younger generation through personal contact with those who teach, not—or at least not in the main—through textbooks. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture.

** Letter to the editor of ''The Reporter'' about the situation of scientists in America (13 October 1954)

* The theory of relativity is a beautiful example of the basic character of the modern development of theory. That is to say, the hypotheses from which one starts become ever more abstract and more remote from experience. But in return one comes closer to the preeminent goal of science, that of encompassing a maximum of empirical contents through logical deduction with a minimum of hypotheses or axioms. The intellectual path from the axioms to the empirical contents or to the testable consequences becomes, thereby, ever longer and more subtle. '''The theoretician is forced, ever more, to allow himself to be directed by purely mathematical, formal points of view in the search for theories, because the physical experience of the experimenter is not capable of leading us up to the regions of the highest abstraction.''' Tentative deduction takes the place of the predominantly inductive methods appropriate to the youthful state of science. Such a theoretical structure must be quite thoroughly elaborated in order for it to lead to consequences that can be compared with experience. It is certainly the case that here, as well, the empirical fact is the all-powerful judge. But its judgment can be handed down only on the basis of great and difficult intellectual effort that first bridges the wide space between the axioms and the testable consequences. The theorist must accomplish this Herculean task with the clear understanding that this effort may only be destined to prepare the way for a death sentence for his theory. '''One should not reproach the theorist who undertakes such a task by calling him a fantast; instead, one must allow him his fantasizing, since for him there is no other way to his goal whatsoever. Indeed, it is no planless fantasizing, but rather a search for the logically simplest possibilities and their consequences.'''

* During that year in Aarau the question came to me: If one runs after a light wave with [a velocity equal to the] light velocity, then one would encounter a time-independent wavefield. However, something like that does not seem to exist! This was the first juvenile thought experiment which has to do with the special theory of relativity.

* The work on satisfactory formulation of technical patents was a true blessing for me. It compelled me to be many-sided in thought, and also offered important stimulation for thought about physics. Following a practical profession is a blessing for people of my type. Because the academic career puts a young person in a sort of compulsory situation to produce scientific papers in impressive quantity, a temptation to superficiality arises that only strong characters are able to resist.

: &lt;small&gt;''Scientific American'' (April 1950)&lt;/small&gt;

* This is the reason why all attempts to obtain a deeper knowledge of the foundations of physics seem doomed to me unless the basic concepts are in accordance with general relativity from the beginning. This situation makes it difficult to use our empirical knowledge, however comprehensive, in looking for the fundamental concepts and relations of physics, and it forces us to apply free speculation to a much greater extent than is presently assumed by most physicists.

* I do not see any reason to assume that the heuristic significance of the principle of general relativity is restricted to gravitation and that the rest of physics can be dealt with separately on the basis of special relativity, with the hope that later on the whole may be fitted consistently into a general relativistic scheme. I do not think that such an attitude, although historically understandable, can be objectively justified. The comparative smallness of what we know today as gravitational effects is not a conclusive reason for ignoring the principle of general relativity in theoretical investigations of a fundamental character. In other words, I do not believe that it is justifiable to ask: What would physics look like without gravitation?

* What is significant in one's own existence one is hardly aware, and it certainly should not bother the other fellow. What does a fish know about the water in which he swims all his life?
** &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1936), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1UxYzuI2oQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5]

* This freedom of communication is indispensable for the development and extension of scientific knowledge, a consideration of much practical import. In the first instance it must be guaranteed by law. '''But laws alone cannot secure freedom of expression; in order that every man may present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance in the entire population.''' Such an ideal of external liberty can never be fully attained but must be sought unremittingly if scientific thought, and philosophical and creative thinking in general, are to be advanced as far as possible.
** &quot;On Freedom&quot; (1940), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1UxYzuI2oQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 13]

* I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity.

* The very fact that the totality of our sense experience is such that by means of thinking (operations with concepts, and the creation and use of definite functional relations between them, and the coordination of sense experience to these concepts) it can be put in order, this fact is one which leaves us in awe, but which we shall never understand. One may say '''&quot;the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.&quot;''' . . . In speaking here concerning &quot;comprehensibility,&quot; the expression is used in its most modest sense. It implies: the production of some sort of order among sense impressions, this order being produced by the creation of general concepts, relations between these concepts, and by relations between the concepts and sense experience, these relations being determined in any possible manner. It is in this sense that the world of our sense experience is comprehensible. '''The fact that it is comprehensible is a miracle.'''
** &quot;Physics and Reality&quot; (1936), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1UxYzuI2oQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 61]

* Intelligence makes clear to us the interrelation of [[means and ends]]. But mere thinking cannot give us a sense of the ultimate and fundamental ends. To make clear these fundamental ends and valuations, and to set them fast in the emotional life of the individual, seems to me precisely the most important function which religion has to perform in the social life of man.
** &quot;Science and Religion&quot; (1939-1941), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1UxYzuI2oQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 22]

* '''The highest principles for our aspirations and judgments are given to us in the Jewish-Christian religious tradition. It is a very high goal which, with our weak powers, we can reach only very inadequately, but which gives a sure foundation to our aspirations and valuations.'''

* '''For scientific endeavor is a natural whole the parts of which mutually support one another in a way which, to be sure, no one can anticipate.'''

* And certainly '''we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. It cannot lead, it can only serve'''; and it is not fastidious in its choice of a leader. This characteristic is reflected in the qualities of its priests, the intellectuals. '''The intellect has a sharp eye for methods and tools, but is blind to ends and values.''' So it is no wonder that this fatal blindness is handed on from old to young and today involves a whole generation.
** &quot;The Goal of Human Existence&quot; (1943)

* One strength of the [[communist system]] of the East is that it has some of the character of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion. Unless the concept of peace based on law gathers behind it the force and zeal of a religion, it can hardly hope to succeed.

* Ethical axioms are founded and tested not very differently from the axioms of science. '''Truth is what stands the test of experience.'''

* How it happened that I in particular discovered the relativity theory, it seemed to lie in the following circumstance. The normal adult never bothers his head about space-time problems. Everything there is to be thought about it, in his opinion, has already been done in early childhood. I, on the contrary, developed so slowly that I only began to wonder about space and time when I was already grown up. In consequence I probed deeper into the problem than an ordinary child would have done.
** In Carl Seelig's ''Albert Einstein: A Documentary Biography'' (1956), Seelig reports that Einstein said this to James Franck, [http://books.google.com/books?id=VCbPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22how+it+happened%22#search_anchor p. 71].
** I sometimes ask myself how did it come that I was the one to develop the theory of relativity. The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops to think about problems of space and time. But my intellectual development was retarded, as a result of which I began to wonder about space and time only when I had already grown up. Naturally, I could go deeper into the problem than a child with normal abilities.

** In the 1985 book ''Einstein in America'', Jamie Sayen wrote &quot;Einstein devised the following explanation for her [Helen Dukas] to give when asked to explain relativity: An hour sitting with a pretty girl on a park bench passes like a minute, but a minute sitting on a hot stove seems like an hour.&quot; ([http://books.google.com/books?ei=yma3TsDWK8WciQL63smAAQ&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;id=vs3aAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=sayen+%22einstein+in+america%22&amp;q=pretty+girl#search_anchor p. 130])

* On quantum theory I use up more brain grease (rough translation of German idiom) than on relativity.
** Quoted by [[Otto Stern]], a colleague of Einstein in Zurich from 1912 to 1914, in a 1962 [http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4904.html oral history interview] with [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas S. Kuhn]]

* In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognise, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support of such views.
** Statement to German anti-Nazi diplomat and author Prince Hubertus zu Lowenstein around 1941, as quoted in his book ''Towards the Further Shore : An Autobiography'' (1968) &lt;!-- p. 156 --&gt;

* Much later, when I was discussing cosmological problems with Einstein, '''he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder he ever made in his life.'''
** [[George Gamow]], in his autobiography ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography'' (1970), p. 44. Here the &quot;cosmological term&quot; refers to the [[wikipedia:Cosmological constant|cosmological constant]] in the equations of general relativity, whose value Einstein initially picked to ensure that his model of the universe would neither expand nor contract; if he hadn't done this he might have theoretically predicted the universal expansion that was first observed by [[Edwin Hubble]].

* We often discussed his notions on objective reality. I recall that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it.
** As recalled by his biographer Abraham Pais in ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 51, 863 (1979): 907. Cited in ''Boojums All The Way Through'' by N. David Mermin (1990), [http://books.google.com/books?id=bf5bjBk095UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 81]

* I said before, the most beautiful and most profound religious emotion that we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. And this mysticality is the power of all true science. If there is any such concept as a God, it is a subtle spirit, not an image of a man that so many have fixed in their minds. In essence, my religion consists of a humble admiration for this illimitable superior spirit that reveals itself in the slight details that we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds.
** As quoted in ''The Private Albert Einstein'' (1992) by Peter A. Bucky and Allen G. Weakland, p. 86

* The physicists say that I am a mathematician, and the mathematicians say that I am a physicist. I am a completely isolated man and though everybody knows me, there are very few people who really know me.

* Never before have I lived through a storm like the one this night. … The sea has a look of indescribable grandeur, especially when the sun falls on it.

* I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or a goal, or anything that could be understood as anthropomorphic.

* The mystical trend of our time, which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so-called Theosophy and Spiritualism, is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion.

And yet, as always, the springtime sun brings forth new life, and we may rejoice because of this new life and contribute to its unfolding; and Mozart remains as beautiful and tender as he always was and always will be. There is, after all, something eternal that lies beyond reach of the hand of fate and of all human delusions. And such eternals lie closer to an older person than to a younger one oscillating between fear and hope. For us, there remains the privilege of experiencing beauty and truth in their purest forms.

* In my opinion, condemning the Zionist movement as &quot;nationalistic&quot; is unjustified. Consider the path by which [[wikipedia:Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] came to his mission. Initially he had been completely cosmopolitan. But during the [[wikipedia:Dreyfus affair|Dreyfus trial]] in Paris he suddenly realized with great clarity how precarious was the situation of the Jews in the western world. And courageously he drew the conclusion that we are discriminated against or murdered not because we are Germans, Frenchmen, Americans, etc. of the &quot;Jewish faith&quot; but simply because we are Jews. Thus already our precarious situation forces us to stand together irrespective of our citizenship.&lt;br /&gt;Zionism gave the German Jews no great protection against annihilation. But it did give the survivors the inner strength to endure the debacle with dignity and without losing their healthy self respect. Keep in mind that perhaps a similar fate could be lying in wait for your children.

: &lt;small&gt;William Hermanns, ''Einstein and the Poet: In Search of the Cosmic Man'' (1983). From a series of meetings Hermanns had with Einstein in 1930, 1943, 1948, and 1954, during which he took notes on what Einstein said (though it's unclear if he recorded the exact phrasing or filled in words from memory). Another person present at the 1954 conversation offered his own slightly different transcription of Einstein's comments, which was published in the article [http://books.google.com/books?id=dlYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Death of a Genius&quot;] from the 2 May, 1955 issue of ''Life Magazine''. &quot;Einstein and the Poet&quot; is viewable on Google Books [http://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC here].&lt;/small&gt;

First conversation (1930):

* School failed me, and I failed the school. It bored me. The teachers behaved like ''Feldwebel'' (sergeants). I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam. What I hated most was the competitive system there, and especially sports. Because of this, I wasn't worth anything, and several times they suggested I leave. This was a Catholic School in Munich. I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a teacher understand youth with such a system? . . . from the age of twelve I began to suspect authority and distrust teachers. I learned mostly at home, first from my uncle and then from a student who came to eat with us once a week. He would give me books on physics and astronomy. The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn't agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation. Then one day this student brought me Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Reading Kant, I began to suspect everything I was taught. I no longer believed in the known God of the Bible, but rather in the mysterious God expressed in nature.
** p. 8

* The basic laws of the universe are simple, but because our senses are limited, we can't grasp them. There is a pattern in creation.
** p. 10

* But we have higher mathematics, haven't we? This gives me freedom from my senses. The language of mathematics is even more inborn and universal than the language of music; a mathematical formula is crystal clear and independent of all sense organs. I therefore built a mathematical laboratory, set myself in it as if I were sitting in a car, and moved along with a beam of light.
** p. 11

* Since others have explained my theory, I can no longer understand it myself.
** p. 13

* Science is never finished because the human mind only uses a small portion of its capacity, and man's exploration of his world is also limited. If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance—whatever name we give him—Creative Force, or God—escapes all book knowledge.
** p. 14

* Many people think that the progress of the human race is based on experiences of an empirical, critical nature, but I say that true knowledge is to be had only through a philosophy of deduction. For it is intuition that improves the world, not just following a trodden path of thought. Intuition makes us look at unrelated facts and then think about them until they can all be brought under one law. To look for related facts means holding onto what one has instead of searching for new facts. Intuition is the father of new knowledge, while [[empiricism]] is nothing but an accumulation of old knowledge. Intuition, not intellect, is the 'open sesame' of yourself.
** p. 16

* What do you think of Spinoza? For me he is the ideal example of the cosmic man. He worked as an obscure diamond cutter, disdaining fame and a place at the table of the great. He tells us the importance of understanding our emotions and suggests what causes them. Man will never be free until he is able to direct his emotions to think clearly. Only then can he control his environment and preserve his energy for creative work.
** p. 26

* What a betrayal of man's dignity. '''He uses the highest gift, his mind, only ten percent, and his emotions and instincts ninety percent.'''
** p. 31
** Spoken on hearing German marchers singing war songs. On p. 474 of Alice Calaprice's ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein'', she lists &quot;we only use 10 percent of our brain&quot; as a quote &quot;misattributed to Einstein&quot;, perhaps this is the source of the misquote? Einstein seems to be speaking metaphorically here, not endorsing the [http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percent.asp myth] that science has shown 90 percent of the neurons in our brain lie dormant. And the myth dates back to before this interview, for example the book ''Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain'', edited by Sergio Della Salla, has a chapter by Barry L. Beyerstein titled &quot;Whence Cometh the Myth that We Only Use 10% of our Brains?&quot; which shows on p. 11 an advertisement from the 1929 ''World Almanac'' containing the line &quot;There is NO LIMIT to what the human brain can accomplish. Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PER CENT of our brain power.&quot;

Second conversation (1943):

* Matter is real to my senses, but they aren't trustworthy. If [[Galileo]] or [[Copernicus]] had accepted what they saw, they would never have discovered the movement of the earth and planets.
** p. 59

* Electromagnetic fields are not of the mind... Creation may be spiritual in origin, but that doesn't mean that everything created is spiritual. How can I explain such things to you? '''Let us [[accept]] the [[world]] is a [[mystery]]. [[Nature]] is neither solely [[material]] nor entirely [[spiritual]]. [[Man]], too, is more than flesh and [[blood]]; otherwise, no [[religions]] would have been possible. Behind each [[cause]] is still another cause; the [[end]] or the [[beginning]] of [[all]] causes has yet to be found. Behind each cause is still another cause; the end or the beginning of all causes has yet to be found. Yet, only one thing must be remembered: there is no effect without a cause, and there is no lawlessness in creation&quot;.'''
** p. 59

* If I hadn't an absolute faith in the harmony of creation, I wouldn't have tried for thirty years to express it in a mathematical formula. It is only man's consciousness of what he does with his mind that elevates him above the animals, and enables him to become aware of himself and his relationship to the universe.
** p. 61

* I believe that I have cosmic religious feelings. I never could grasp how one could satisfy these feelings by praying to limited objects. The tree outside is life, a statue is dead. The whole of nature is life, and life, as I observe it, rejects a God resembling man. I like to experience the universe as one harmonious whole. Every cell has life. Matter, too, has life; it is energy solidified. Our bodies are like prisons, and I look forward to be free, but I don't speculate on what will happen to me. I live here now, and my responsibility is in this world now. . . . I deal with natural laws. This is my work here on earth.
** p. 64

* The world needs new moral impulses which, I'm afraid, won't come from the churches, heavily compromised as they have been throughout the centuries. Perhaps those impulses must come from scientists in the tradition of Galileo, Kepler and Newton. In spite of failures and persecutions, these men devoted their lives to proving that the universe is a single entity, in which, I believe, a humanized God has no place. The genuine scientist is not moved by praise or blame, nor does he preach. He unveils the universe and people come eagerly, without being pushed, to behold a new revelation: the order, the harmony, the magnificence of creation! And as man becomes conscious of the stupendous laws that govern the universe in perfect harmony, he begins to realize how small he is. He sees the pettiness of human existence, with its ambitions and intrigues, its 'I am better than thou' creed. This is the beginning of cosmic religion within him; fellowship and human service become his moral code. And without such moral foundations, we are hopelessly doomed.
** p. 66

Third conversation (1948):

* '''The God Spinoza revered is my God, too: I meet Him everyday in the harmonious laws which govern the universe.''' My religion is cosmic, and my God is too universal to concern himself with the intentions of every human being.

* If we want to improve the world we cannot do it with scientific knowledge but with ideals. [[Confucius]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]] and [[Gandhi]] have done more for [[humanity]] than science has done. We must begin with the [[heart]] of man—with his [[conscience]]—and the values of conscience can only be manifested by selfless service to mankind. In this respect, I feel that the Churches have much guilt. She has always allied herself with those who rule, who have political power, and more often than not, at the expense of peace and humanity as a whole.
** p. 92

* [[Religion]] and [[science]] go together. As I've said before, science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind. They are interdependent and have a common goal—the search for truth. Hence it is absurd for religion to proscribe Galileo or Darwin or other scientists. And it is equally absurd when scientists say that there is no God. The real scientist has faith, which does not mean that he must subscribe to a creed. Without religion there is no charity. The soul given to each of us is moved by the same living spirit that moves the universe.

* Philosophy is empty if it isn't based on science. Science discovers, philosophy interprets.

* And the traditional religions worry me. Their long history proves that they have not understood the meaning of the commandment: Thou shalt not kill. If we want to save this world from unimaginable destruction we should concentrate not on the faraway God, but on the heart of the individual. We live now in an international anarchy in which a Third World War with nuclear weapons lies before our door. We must make the individual man aware of his conscience so that he understands what it means that only a few will survive the next war.

* Indeed, it is not intellect, but intuition which advances humanity. Intuition tells man his purpose in this life.

* I do not need any promise of eternity to be happy. My eternity is now. I have only one interest: to fulfill my purpose here where I am. This purpose is not given me by my parents or my surroundings. It is induced by some unknown factors. These factors make me a part of eternity.
** p. 103

* I cannot conceive of anything after my physical death—perhaps it will end it all. The knowledge that I am now on this earth and a mysterious part of eternity is enough for me. My death will be an easy one, too, for since early youth I have always detached myself from family, friends, and surroundings. And should I live on, I have no fear of the next life. Whatever good I did helped to free me from myself. What a miserable creature man would be if he were good not for the sake of being good, but because religion told him that he would get a reward after this life, and that if he weren't good he'd be punished.

* ''[in response to a question about what was meant by his &quot;cosmic religion&quot;]'' It is not a religion that teaches that man is made in the image of God—that is anthropomorphic. Man has infinite dimensions and finds God in his conscience. This religion has no dogma other than teaching man that the universe is rational and that his highest destiny is to ponder it and co-create with its laws. There are only two limiting factors: first, that what seems impenetrable to us is as important as what is cut and dried; and, second, that our faculties are dull and can only comprehend wisdom and serene beauty in crude forms, but the heart of man through intuition leads us to greater understanding of ourselves and the universe. My religion is based on Moses: Love God and love your neighbor as yourself. And for me God is the First Cause. David and the prophets knew that there could be no love without justice or justice without love. I don't need any other religious trappings.

Fourth conversation (1954):

* Wait a minute! I am not a mystic. Trying to find out the laws of nature has nothing to do with mysticism, though in the face of creation I feel very humble. It is as if a spirit is manifest infinitely superior to man's spirit. Through my pursuit in science I have known cosmic religious feelings. But I don't care to be called a mystic.
** p. 117

* About God, I cannot accept any concept based on the authority of the Church. As long as I can remember, I have resented mass indoctrination. I do not believe in the fear of life, in the fear of death, in blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him, I would be a liar. '''I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil. My God created laws that take care of that. His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking, but by immutable laws.'''
** p. 132

* You must warn people not to make the intellect their God. The intellect knows methods but it seldom knows values, and they come from feeling. If one doesn't play a part in the creative whole, he is not worth being called human. He has betrayed his true purpose.

* Certainly there are things worth believing. I believe in the brotherhood of man and in personal originality. But if you asked me to prove what I believe, I couldn't. You can spend your whole life trying to prove what you believe; you may hunt for reasons, but it will all be in vain. Yet our beliefs are like our existence; they are facts. If you don't yet know what to believe in, then try to learn what you feel and desire.

** Variant transcription from &quot;Death of a Genius&quot; in ''Life Magazine'': &quot;Certainly there are things worth believing. I believe in the brotherhood of man and the uniqueness of the individual. But if you ask me to prove what I believe, I can't. You know them to be true but you could spend a whole lifetime without being able to prove them. The mind can proceed only so far upon what it knows and can prove. There comes a point where the mind takes a leap—call it intuition or what you will—and comes out upon a higher plane of knowledge, but can never prove how it got there. All great discoveries have involved such a leap.&quot;
** Unsourced variant: &quot;The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, and the solution comes to you and you do not know how or why.

* It's not as simple as that. Knowledge is necessary, too. An intuitive child couldn't accomplish anything without some knowledge. There will come a point in everyone's life, however, where only intuition can make the leap ahead, without ever knowing precisely how. One can never know why, but one must accept intuition as a fact.
** p. 137
** In response to statement &quot;You once told me that progress is made only by intuition, and not by the accumulation of knowledge.&quot;
** Variant transcription from &quot;Death of a Genius&quot; in ''Life Magazine'': &quot;It is not quite so simple. Knowledge is necessary too. A child with great intuition could not grow up to become something worthwhile in life without some knowledge. However there comes a point in everyone's life where only intuition can make the leap ahead, without knowing precisely how.&quot;:

* Don't think about why you question, simply don't stop questioning. Don't worry about what you can't answer, and don't try to explain what you can't know. Curiosity is its own reason. Aren't you in awe when you contemplate the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure behind reality? And this is the miracle of the human mind—to use its constructions, concepts, and formulas as tools to explain what man sees, feels and touches. Try to comprehend a little more each day. Have holy curiosity.
** p. 138
** Variant transcription from &quot;Death of a Genius&quot; in ''Life Magazine'': &quot;Then do not stop to think about the reasons for what you are doing, about why you are questioning. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reasons for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity.&quot;

* First you must have faith in an eternal world independent of you; then you must have faith in your ability to perceive it, and finally you must try to explain it by means of concepts or mathematical constructions. But don't always accept traditional concepts without reexamining them. Even overthrow my relativity theory, if you find a better one. . . . You must believe that the world was created as a unified whole which is comprehensible to man. Of course, it's going to take an infinitely long time to investigate this unified creation. But to me that is the highest and most sacred duty—unifying physics. Simplicity is the criterion of the universe.

* Try not to become a man of success, but a man of value. Look around at how people want to get more out of life than they put in. A man of value will give more than he receives. Be creative, but make sure that what you create is not a curse for mankind.

* A man who is convinced of the truth of his religion is indeed never tolerant. At the least, he is to feel pity for the adherent of another religion but usually it does not stop there. The faithful adherent of a religion will try first of all to convince those that believe in another religion and usually he goes on to hatred if he is not successful. However, hatred then leads to persecution when the might of the majority is behind it.&lt;br /&gt; In the case of a Christian clergyman, the tragic-comical is found in this: that the Christian religion demands love from the faithful, even love for the enemy. This demand, because it is indeed superhuman, he is unable to fulfill. Thus intolerance and hatred ring through the oily words of the clergyman. The love, which on the Christian side is the basis for the conciliatory attempt towards Judaism is the same as the love of a child for a cake. That means that it contains the hope that the object of the love will be eaten up...

* Professor Smith has kindly submitted his book to me before publication. After reading it thoroughly and with intense interest I am glad to comply with his request to give him my impression. &lt;br /&gt; The work is a broadly conceived attempt to portray man's fear-induced animistic and mythic ideas with all their far-flung transformations and interrelations. It relates the impact of these phantasmagorias on human destiny and the causal relationships by which they have become crystallized into organized religion. &lt;br /&gt; This is a biologist speaking, whose scientific training has disciplined him in a grim objectivity rarely found in the pure historian. This objectivity has not, however, hindered him from emphasizing the boundless suffering which, in its end results, this mythic thought has brought upon man. &lt;br /&gt; Professor Smith envisages as a redeeming force, training in objective observation of all that is available for immediate perception and in the interpretation of facts without preconceived ideas. In his view, only if every individual strives for truth can humanity attain a happier future; the atavisms in each of us that stand in the way of a friendlier destiny can only thus be rendered ineffective. &lt;br /&gt; His historical picture closes with the end of the nineteenth century, and with good reason. By that time it seemed that the influence of these mythic, authoritatively anchored forces which can be denoted as religious, had been reduced to a tolerable level in spite of all the persisting inertia and hypocrisy. &lt;br /&gt; Even then, a new branch of mythic thought had already grown strong, one not religious in nature but no less perilous to mankind — exaggerated nationalism. Half a century has shown that this new adversary is so strong that it places in question man's very survival. It is too early for the present-day historian to write about this problem, but it is to be hoped that one will survive who can undertake the task at a later date.
** Foreword of &quot;Man and his Gods&quot; by Homer W. Smith

* '''We followers of [[Spinoza]] see our God in the wonderful order and lawfulness of all that exists and in its soul (&quot;Beseeltheit&quot;) as it reveals itself in man and animal.''' It is a different question whether belief in a personal God should be contested. Freud endorsed this view in his latest publication. I myself would never engage in such a task. For such a belief seems to me preferable to the lack of any transcendental outlook of life, and I wonder whether one can ever successfully render to the majority of mankind a more sublime means in order to satisfy its metaphysical needs.
** From a letter to Eduard Büsching (25 October 1929) after Büsching sent Einstein a copy of his book ''Es gibt keinen Gott'' [''There Is no God'']. Einstein responded that the book only dealt with the concept of a ''personal'' God, p. 51

* Speaking of the spirit that informs modern scientific investigations, I am of the opinion that all the finer speculations in the realm of science spring from a deep religious feeling, and that without such a feeling they would not be fruitful. '''I also believe that, this kind of religiousness, which makes itself felt today in scientific investigations, is the only creative religious activity of our time.''' The art of today can hardly be looked upon at all as expressive of our religious instincts.
** Interview with J. Murphy and J. W. N. Sullivan (1930), p. 68

* Scientific research is based on the assumption that all events, including the actions of mankind, are determined by the laws of nature. Therefore, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, that is, by a wish addressed to a supernatural Being. However, we have to admit that our actual knowledge of these laws is only an incomplete piece of work (unvollkommenes Stückwerk), so that ultimately the belief in the existence of fundamental all-embracing laws also rests on a sort of faith. All the same, this faith has been largely justified by the success of science. On the other hand, however, '''every one who is seriously engaged in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.''' The pursuit of science leads therefore to a religious feeling of a special kind, which differs essentially from the religiosity of more naive people.

* I was barked at by numerous dogs who are earning their food guarding ignorance and superstition for the benefit of those who profit from it. Then there are the fanatical atheists whose intolerance is of the same kind as the intolerance of the religious fanatics and comes from the same source. They are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who—in their grudge against the traditional &quot;opium for the people&quot;—cannot bear the music of the spheres. '''The Wonder of nature does not become smaller because one cannot measure it by the standards of human moral and human aims.'''
** Letter (7 August 1941) discussing responses to his essay &quot;Science and Religion&quot; (1941), p. 97

* I have found no better expression than &quot;religious&quot; for confidence in the rational nature of reality as it is accessible to human reason. Wherever this feeling is absent, science degenerates into uninspired empiricism. … I cannot accept your opinion concerning science and ethics or the determination of aims. What we call science has the sole purpose of determining what ''is''. The determining of what ''ought to be'' is unrelated to it and cannot be accomplished methodically. '''Science can only arrange ethical propositions logically and furnish the means for the realization of ethical aims, but the determination of aims is beyond its scope.''' At least that is the way I see it.
** Letter to his friend Maurice Solovine (1 January 1951) p. 120

* The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naive. However, I am also not a &quot;Freethinker&quot; in the usual sense of the word because I find that this is in the main an attitude nourished exclusively by an opposition against naive superstition. My feeling is insofar religious as I am imbued with the consciousness of the insufficiency of the human mind to understand deeply the harmony of the Universe which we try to formulate as &quot;laws of nature.&quot; It is this consciousness and humility I miss in the Free-thinker mentality.

* '''There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is.'''
** As quoted in ''Journal of France and Germany'' (1942–1944) by [[w:Gilbert F. White|Gilbert Fowler White]], in excerpt published in ''Living with Nature's Extremes: The Life of Gilbert Fowler White'' (2006) by Robert E. Hinshaw, p. 62. From the [http://books.google.com/books?id=_2qfZRp9SeEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false context] it seems that White did not specify whether he had heard Einstein himself say this or whether he was repeating a quote that had been passed along by someone else, so without a primary source the validity of this quote should be considered questionable. &lt;br /&gt; Some have argued that elsewhere Einstein defined a &quot;miracle&quot; as a type of event he did not believe was possible—''Einstein on Religion'' by Max Jammer (1999) quotes on p. 89 from a 1931 conversation Einstein had with David Reichinstein, where Reichinstein brought up philosopher Arthur Liebert's argument that the indeterminism of quantum mechanics might allow for the possibility of miracles, and Einstein replied that Liebert's argument dealt &quot;with a domain in which lawful rationality [determinism] does not exist. A 'miracle,' however, is an exception from lawfulness; hence, there where lawfulness does not exist, also its exception, i.e., a miracle, cannot exist.&quot; (&quot;''Dort, wo eine Gesetzmässigkeit nicht vorhanden ist, kann auch ihre Ausnahme, d.h. ein Wunder, nicht existieren.''&quot; D. Reichenstein, ''Die Religion der Gebildeten'' (1941), p. 21).  However, it is clear from the context that Einstein was stating only that miracles cannot exist in a domain (quantum mechanics) where lawful rationality does not exist.  He did not claim that miracles could never exist in any domain.  Indeed, Einstein clearly believed, as seen in many quotations above, that the universe was comprehensible and rational, but he also described this characteristic of the universe as a &quot;miracle&quot;. In another example, he is quoted as claiming belief in a God, &quot;Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world.&quot;

In any case, the interview was republished in a book of the same title, and Einstein wrote a foreword which praised Barrett's work on the book, so it's likely he read the quote about common sense and at least had no objection to it, whether or not he recalled making the specific comment.

* The really valuable thing is intuition.
**Although similar to many of Einstein's comments about the importance of intuition and imagination, no sources for this can be found prior to ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' by Robert Evan Ornstein (1973), [http://books.google.com/books?id=0Yh9AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22really+valuable+thing+is+intuition%22#search_anchor p. 68], where there is no mention of where the quote was originally made. A number of early sources from the 1980s and 1990s attribute it to ''The Intuitive Edge'' by Philip Goldberg (1983), which also provides no original source.

* Two things are infinite: the universe and the human stupidity.
** As discussed in [http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/04/universe-einstein/#more-173 this entry from The Quote Investigator], the earliest published attribution of a similar quote to Einstein seems to have been in Gestalt therapist [[w:Fritz Perls|Frederick S. Perls]]' 1969 book ''Gestalt Theory Verbatim'', where he wrote on p. 33: &quot;As Albert Einstein once said to me: 'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity.' But what is much more widespread than the actual stupidity is the playing stupid, turning off your ear, not listening, not seeing.&quot; Perls also offered another variant in his 1972 book ''In and Out the Garbage Pail'', where he mentioned a meeting with Einstein and on [http://books.google.com/books?id=HuxFAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=human+stupidity#search_anchor p. 52] quoted him saying: &quot;Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe.&quot; However, Perls had given yet another variant of this quote in an earlier book, ''Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: a Revision of Freud’s Theory and Method'' (originally published 1942, although the Quote Investigator only checked that the quote appeared in the 1947 edition), where he attributed it not to Einstein but to a &quot;great astronomer&quot;, writing: &quot;As modern times promote hasty eating to a large extent, it is not surprising to learn that a great astronomer said: 'Two things are infinite, as far as we know – the universe and human stupidity.' To-day we know that this statement is not quite correct. Einstein has proved that the universe is limited.&quot; So, the later attributions in 1969 and 1972 may have been a case of faulty memory, or of intentionally trying to increase the authority of the quote by attributing it to Einstein. The quote itself may be a variant of a similar quote attributed even earlier to the philosopher [[w:Ernest Renan|Ernest Renan]], found for example in ''The Public: Volume 18'' from 1915, which says on [http://books.google.com/books?id=cTPmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 1126]: &quot;He quotes the saying of Renan: it isn't the stars that give him an idea of infinity; it is man's stupidity.&quot; (Other examples of similar attributions to Renan can be found on [http://www.google.com/search?q=renan+infinity+stupidity&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 this Google Books search].) Renan was French so this is presumably intended as a translation, but different sources give different versions of the supposed original French quote, such as &quot;''La bêtise humaine est la seule chose qui donne une idée de l'infini''&quot; (found for example in ''Réflexions sur la vie, 1895-1898'' by Remy de Gourmont from 1903, [http://books.google.com/books?id=RtrtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 103], along with several other early sources as seen in [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22humaine+est+la+seule+chose+qui%22+renan&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 this search]) and &quot;''Ce n'est pas l'immensité de la voûte étoilée qui peut donner le plus complétement l'idée de l'infini, mais bien la bêtise humaine!''&quot; (found in ''Broad views, Volume 2'' from 1904, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9NEaAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA465#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 465]). Since these variants have not been found in Renan's own writings, they may represent false attributions as well. They may also be variants of an even older saying; for example, the 1880 book ''Des vers'' by [[Guy de Maupassant]] includes on [http://books.google.com/books?id=cQUvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 9] a quote from a letter (dated February 19, 1880) by [[Gustave Flaubert]] where Flaubert writes &quot;''Cependant, qui sait? La terre a des limites, mais la bêtise humaine est infinie!''&quot; which translates to &quot;But who knows? The earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is infinite!&quot; Similarly the 1887 book ''Melanges'' by [[w:Jules-Paul Tardivel|Jules-Paul Tardivel]] includes on [http://books.google.com/books?id=n9cOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 273] a piece said to have been written in 1880 in which he writes &quot;''Aujourd'hui je sais qu'il n'y a pas de limites à la bêtise humaine, qu'elle est infinie''&quot; which translates to &quot;today I know that there is no limit to human stupidity, it is infinite.&quot;
**Variant: &quot;Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.&quot; Earliest version located is in ''Technocracy digest: Issues 287–314'' from 1988, [http://books.google.com/books?id=L7LnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22sure+about+the+former%22#search_anchor p. 76].

* Contempt prior to investigation is what enslaves a mind to Ignorance.
** This or similar statements are more often misattributed to [[Herbert Spencer]], but the source of the phrase &quot;contempt prior to investigation&quot; seems to have been [[William Paley]], ''A View of the Evidences of Christianity'' (1794): &quot;The infidelity of the Gentile world, and that more especially of men of rank and learning in it, is resolved into a principle which, in my judgment, will account for the inefficacy of any argument, or any evidence whatever, ''viz''. contempt prior to examination.&quot;

*Being a lover of freedom, when the revolution came in Germany, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but, no, the universities immediately were silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone by had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks. Then I looked to individual writers who, as literary guides of Germany, had written much and often concerning the place of freedom in modern life; but they, too, were mute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly.
**Attributed in “The Conflict Between Church And State In The Third Reich”, by [[w:S. Parkes Cadman|S. Parkes Cadman]], ''La Crosse Tribune and Leader-Press'' (28 October 1934), viewable online on p. 9 of the issue [http://newspaperarchive.com/us/wisconsin/la-crosse/la-crosse-tribune-and-leader-press/1934/10-28/ here] (double-click the page to zoom). The quote is preceded by “In this connection it is worth quoting ''in free translation'' a statement made by Professor Einstein last year to one of my colleagues who has been prominently identified with the Protestant church in its contacts with Germany.” [Emphasis added.] '''While based on something that Einstein said, Einstein himself stated that the quote was not an accurate record of his words or opinion.''' After the quote appeared in ''Time'' magazine (23 December 1940), [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765103,00.html p. 38], a minister in Harbor Springs, Michigan wrote to Einstein to check if the quote was real. Einstein wrote back “'''It is true that I made a statement which corresponds approximately with the text you quoted. I made this statement during the first years of the Nazi-Regime — much earlier than 1940 — and my expressions were a little more moderate.'''” (March 1943) [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200706A19.html]
**In a later letter to Rev. Cornelius Greenway of Brooklyn, who asked if Einstein would write out the statement in his own hand, Einstein was more vehement in his repudiation of the statement (14 November 1950) [http://books.google.com/books?id=T5R7JsRRtoIC&amp;pg=PA94]: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''The wording of the statement you have quoted is not my own.''' Shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany I had an oral conversation with a newspaper man about these matters. '''Since then my remarks have been elaborated and exaggerated nearly beyond recognition. I cannot in good conscience write down the statement you sent me as my own.'''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The matter is all the more embarrassing to me because I, like yourself, I am predominantly critical concerning the activities, and especially the political activities, through history of the official clergy. '''Thus, my former statement, even if reduced to my actual words (which I do not remember in detail) gives a wrong impression of my general attitude.'''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:: In his original statement Einstein was probably referring to the actions of the [[w:Pfarrernotbund|Emergency Covenant of Pastors]] organized by [[Martin Niemöller]], and the [[w:Confessing Church|Confessing Church]] which he and other prominent churchmen such as [[Karl Barth]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] established in opposition to Nazi policies.
:: Einstein also made some scathingly negative comments about the behavior of the Church under the Nazi regime (and its behavior towards Jews throughout history) in a 1943 conversation with William Hermanns recorded in Hermanns' book ''Einstein and the Poet'' (1983). On [http://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 63] Hermanns records him saying &quot;Never in history has violence been so widespread as in Nazi Germany. The concentration camps make the actions of Ghengis Khan look like child's play. But what makes me shudder is that the Church is silent. One doesn't need to be a prophet to say, 'The Catholic Church will pay for this silence.' Dr. Hermanns, you will live to see that there is moral law in the universe. . . .There are cosmic laws, Dr. Hermanns. They cannot be bribed by prayers or incense. What an insult to the principles of creation. But remember, that for God a thousand years is a day. This power maneuver of the Church, these Concordats through the centuries with worldly powers . . . the Church has to pay for it. We live now in a scientific age and in a psychological age. You are a sociologist, aren't you? You know what the ''Herdenmenschen'' (men of herd mentality) can do when they are organized and have a leader, especially if he is a spokesmen for the Church. I do not say that the unspeakable crimes of the Church for 2000 years had always the blessings of the Vatican, but it vaccinated its believers with the idea: We have the true God, and the Jews have crucified Him. The Church sowed hate instead of love, though the Ten Commandments state: Thou shalt not kill.&quot; And then on [http://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 64]: &quot;I'm not a Communist but I can well understand why they destroyed the Church in Russia. All the wrongs come home, as the proverb says. The Church will pay for its dealings with Hitler, and Germany, too.&quot; And on [http://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 65]: &quot;I don't like to implant in youth the Church's doctrine of a personal God, because that Church has behaved so inhumanely in the past 2000 years. The fear of punishment makes the people march. Consider the hate the Church manifested against the Jews and then against the Muslims, the Crusades with their crimes, the burning stakes of the Inquisition, the tacit consent of Hitler's actions while the Jews and the Poles dug their own graves and were slaughtered. And Hitler is said to have been an alter boy! The truly religious man has no fear of life and no fear of death—and certainly no blind faith; his faith must be in his conscience. . . . I am therefore against all organized religion. Too often in history, men have followed the cry of battle rather than the cry of truth.&quot; When Hermanns asked him &quot;Isn't it only human to move along the line of least resistance?&quot;, Einstein responded &quot;Yes. It is indeed human, as proved by Cardinal Pacelli, who was behind the Concordat with Hitler. Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time? And he is now the Pope! The moment I hear the word 'religion', my hair stands on end. The Church has always sold itself to those in power, and agreed to any bargain in return for immunity. It would have been fine if the spirit of religion had guided the Church; instead, the Church determined the spirit of religion. Churchmen through the ages have fought political and institutional corruption very little, so long as their own sanctity and church property were preserved.&quot;

* Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.
** Variant: The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs, it would be Buddhism.
** These two statements are very similar, widely quoted, and seem to paraphrase some ideas in the essay &quot;[[Albert_Einstein#Religion_and_Science_.281930.29|Religion and Science]]&quot; (see below), but neither of the two specific quotes above been properly sourced. Notable Einstein scholars such as John Stachel and Thomas J. McFarlane (author of ''Buddha and Einstein: The Parallel Sayings'') know of this statement but have not found any source for it. Any information on any definite original sources for these is welcome.
** This quote does not actually appear in ''Albert Einstein: The Human Side'' as is sometimes claimed.
** Only two sources from before 1970 can be found on Google Books. The first is ''The Theosophist: Volume 86'' which seems to cover the years [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pLjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=1964#search_anchor 1964] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pLjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=1965#search_anchor 1965]. The quote appears attributed to Einstein on [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pLjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22natural+and+spiritual%22#search_anchor p. 255], with the wording given as &quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description.&quot; An identical quote appears on [http://books.google.com/books?id=YpsfAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22dogmas+and+theology%22#search_anchor p. 284] of ''The Maha Bodhi: Volume 72'' published by the Maha Bodhi Society of India, which seems to contain issues from [http://books.google.com/books?id=YpsfAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22volume+72%22#search_anchor throughout 1964].
** A number of phrases in the quote are similar to phrases in Einstein's &quot;Religion and Science&quot;. Comparing the version of the quote in ''The Theosophist'' to the version of &quot;Religion and Science&quot; published in 1930, &quot;a cosmic religion&quot; in the first resembles &quot;the cosmic religious sense&quot; in the second; &quot;transcend a personal God&quot; resembles &quot;does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God&quot;; &quot;covering both the natural and the spiritual&quot; resembles &quot;revealed in nature and in the world of thought&quot;; &quot;the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity&quot; resembles &quot;experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance&quot;; and &quot;Buddhism answers this description&quot; resembles &quot;The cosmic element is much stronger in Buddhism&quot;. These phrases appear in the same order in both cases, and the ones from &quot;Religion and Science&quot; are all from a single paragraph of the essay.

* If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.

Koestler prefaces it with &quot;My comfort is what Einstein said when somebody reproached him with the suggestion that his formula of gravitation was longer and more cumbersome than Newton's formula in its elegant simplicity&quot;. This is actually a variant of a quote Einstein attributed to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]; in the Preface to his ''Relativity—The Special and General Theory'' (1916), Einstein wrote: &quot;I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.&quot; (reprinted in the 2007 book ''A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion: The Essential Scientific Works of Albert Einstein'' edited by Stephen Hawking, [http://books.google.com/books?id=th3Cpu_QYVQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 128])

* Two things inspire me to awe: the starry heavens and the moral universe within.
** If Einstein said this, he was almost certainly quoting philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s words from the conclusion to the ''Critique of Practical Reason'' (1788), translated in Paul Guyer's ''The Cambridge Companion to Kant'' ([http://books.google.com/books?id=pYE5rVzrPNgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 1]) as: &quot;Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.&quot;

* The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.
** This is similar to a quote attributed to [[Mark Twain]]: &quot;I never let my schooling get in the way of my education&quot;.

* The search for truth is more precious than its possession.
** This quote does appear in Einstein's 1940 essay &quot;The Fundaments of Physics&quot; which can be found in his book ''Out of My Later Years'' (1950), but Einstein does not claim credit for it, instead calling it &quot;[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s fine saying&quot;.

* Time and space are modes by which we think and not conditions in which we live.
** Earliest source located that attributes this to Einstein is the 1975 book ''The Nature of Scientific Discovery: A Symposium Commemorating the 500th Anniversary of the Birth of Nicolaus Copernicus'' edited by Owen Gingerich, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ub3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22certainly+a+central%22#search_anchor p. 585]. But long before that, the 1944 book ''Einstein: An Intimate Study of a Great Man'' by Dimitri Marianoff and Palma Wayne contains the following quote on p. 62: &quot;But Einstein came along and took space and time out of the realm of stationary things and put them in the realm of relativity—giving the onlooker dominion over time and space, because time and space are modes by which we think and not conditions in which we live.&quot; It appears from the quote that the authors were giving their own description of Einstein's ideas, not quoting him.

** variant: If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
** Frequently attributed to [[Richard Feynman]]
** Probably based on a similar quote about explaining physics to a &quot;barmaid&quot; by [[Ernest Rutherford]]
** Page 418 of ''Einstein: His Life and Times'' (1972) by Ronald W. Clark says that [[Louis de Broglie]] did attribute a similar statement to Einstein:
**: To de Broglie, Einstein revealed an instinctive reason for his inability to accept the purely [[w:Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Ensemble interpretation, or statistical interpretation|statistical interpretation]] of wave mechanics. It was a reason which linked him with Rutherford, who used to state that &quot;it should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.&quot; Einstein, having a final discussion with de Broglie on the platform of the Gare du Nord in Paris, whence they had traveled from Brussels to attend the Fresnel centenary celebrations, said &quot;that all physical theories, their mathematical expressions apart ought to lend themselves to so simple a description 'that even a child could understand them.' &quot;
** The de Broglie quote is from his 1962 book ''New Perspectives in Physics'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=xY45AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22mathematical+expression+apart%22#search_anchor p. 184].
** Cf. this quote from [[David Hilbert]]'s talk ''Mathematical Problems'' given in 1900 before the International Congress of Mathematicians:
**: &quot;A mathematical theory is not to be considered complete until you have made it so clear that you can explain it to the first man whom you meet on the street.&quot;
** Cf. this quote from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'':
:: Dr. Hoenikker used to say that any scientist who couldn't explain to an eight-year-old what he was doing was a charlatan.

* You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.
** Earliest published version found on Google Books with this phrasing is in the 1993 book ''The Internet Companion: A Beginner's Guide to Global Networking'' by Tracy L. LaQuey and Jeanne C. Ryer, [http://books.google.com/books?id=sP5SAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=meowing#search_anchor p. 25]. However, the quote seems to have been circulating on the internet earlier than this, appearing for example in [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c/msg/cc89abb5e065d23f?hl=en this post from 1987] and [http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources.games/browse_thread/thread/846af15b5a38c35/3d6d5a639c24bba3 this one from 1985]. No reference has been found that cites a source in Einstein's original writings, and the quote appears to be a variation of an old joke that dates at least as far back as 1866, as discussed in [http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/24/telegraph-cat/#more-3387 this entry from the &quot;Quote Investigator&quot; blog]. A variant was told by [[Thomas Edison]], appearing in ''The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison'' (1948), [http://books.google.com/books?id=NXtEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=edinburgh#search_anchor p. 216]: &quot;When I was a little boy, persistently trying to find out how the telegraph worked and why, the best explanation I ever got was from an old Scotch line repairer who said that if you had a dog like a dachshund long enough to reach from Edinburgh to London, if you pulled his tail in Edinburgh he would bark in London. I could understand that. But it was hard to get at what it was that went through the dog or over the wire.&quot; A variant of Edison's comment can be found in the 1910 book ''Edison, His Life and Inventions, Volume 1'' by Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=qN83AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 53].
** The wireless telegraph is not difficult to understand. The ordinary telegraph is like a very long cat. You pull the tail in New York, and it meows in Los Angles. The wireless is the same, only without the cat.
***Variant, earliest known published version is ''How to Think Like Einstein'' by Scott Thorpe (2000), [http://books.google.com/books?id=9yrYQxBgIYEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 61].

*The mind that opens to a new idea, Never comes back to its original size.
**Actually said by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] in his book ''The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table'': &quot;Every now and then a man's mind is stretched by a new idea or sensation, and never shrinks back to its former dimensions.&quot;

* ''Die Astrologie ist eine Wissenschaft für sich. Aber eine wegweisende. Ich habe viel aus ihr gelernt und vielen Nutzen aus ihr ziehen können. Die physikalischen Erkenntnisse unterstreichen die Macht der Sterne über irdisches Geschick. Die Astrologie aber unterstreicht in gewissem Sinne wiederum die physikalischen Erkenntnisse. Deshalb ist sie eine Art Lebens-elixier für die Gesellschaft!''
** ''English:'' Astrology is a science in itself and contains an illuminating body of knowledge. It taught me many things, and I am greatly indebted to it. Geophysical evidence reveals the power of the stars and the planets in relation to the terrestrial. In turn, astrology reinforces this power to some extent. This is why astrology is like a life-giving elixir to mankind.

* A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot.
** A variation on a quotation of [[Alexander Pope]], attributed to Einstein in various recent sources, such as [[Marvin Minsky]]'s ''The Emotion Machine'' (2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=OqbMnWDKIJ4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 176], and at the start of the 2006 pilot episode of the television series [[Eureka (TV series)|Eureka]]. The oldest published source located attributing this to Einstein is the 2004 book ''Strategic Investment: Real Options and Games'' by Han T. J. Smit and Lenos Trigeorgis, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pN41ZtNoqBEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA429#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 429], and before that it was attributed to him on the internet, the earliest example found being [http://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.physhare/msg/ef186aec3bf66ba6 this post from 19 May 1995]. But long before that, the same quote appears in an advertisement for Encyclopaedia Britannica that ran in ''The Atlantic Monthly: Volume 216'' from 1965, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TuMmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22so+is+a+lot%22#search_anchor p. 139]. The ad mentioned Einstein but did not directly attribute the quote to him: &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica says: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot. The more you know, the more you need to know — as Albert Einstein, for one, might have told you. Great knowledge has a way of bringing with it great responsibility. The people who put the Encyclopaedia Britannica together feel the same way. After all, if most of the world had come to count on you as the best single source of complete, accurate, up-to-date information on everything, you'd want to be pretty sure you knew what you were talking about.&quot;

*Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.
** Actually written by [[E. F. Schumacher]] in a 1973 essay titled &quot;Small is Beautiful&quot; which appeared in ''The Radical Humanist: volume 37'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=oA0IAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22more+violent%22#search_anchor p. 22]. Earliest published source found on Google Books attributing this to Einstein is ''BMJ: The British Medical Journal'', volume 319, 23 October 1999, [http://books.google.com/books?id=bQk7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22more+violent%22#search_anchor p. 1102]. It was attributed to Einstein on the internet somewhat before that, for example in [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.weemba/msg/2bbf56ab8f4f757d?hl=en this 1997 post].

* Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination.
** The earliest published source located on Google Books attributing this to Einstein is the 2000 book ''The Internet Handbook for Writers, Researchers, and Journalists'' by Mary McGuire, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Sb-v0K2EkNAC&amp;q=einstein#search_anchor p. 14]. It was attributed to him on the internet before that, as in [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.graphics.apps.lightwave/msg/d13c55cc4cca4867?hl=en this post from 1997]. Variants of the quote can be found well before this however, as in the 1989 book ''Urban Surface Water Management'' by S. G. Walesh, which on [http://books.google.com/books?id=-LcZUPtDykQC&amp;q=%22beyond+imagination%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22beyond%20imagination%22&amp;f=false p. 315] contains the statement (said to have been 'stated anonymously'): &quot;The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a challenge and opportunity beyond imagination.&quot; Even earlier, the article [http://books.google.com/books?id=A-YpAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22and+direct+digital+control%22#search_anchor &quot;A Paper Industry Application of Systems Engineering and Direct Digital Control&quot;] by H. D. Couture, Jr. and M. A. Keyes, which appears in the 1969 ''Advances in Instrumentation: Vol. 24, Part 4'', has a statement on [http://books.google.com/books?id=A-YpAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Computers+are+incredibly+fast%2C+accurate+and+stupid%22#search_anchor this page] which uses phrasing similar to the supposed Einstein quote in describing computers and people: &quot;Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. On the other hand, a well trained operator as compared with a computer is incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant.&quot; Variants with slightly different wording can be found earlier than 1969, as in [http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1968/04000/Fast,_Accurate_and_Stupid.10.aspx this April 1968 article]. The earliest source located, and most likely the origin of this saying, is an article titled &quot;Problems, Too, Have Problems&quot; by John Pfeiffer, which appeared in the October 1961 issue of ''Fortune'' magazine. As quoted [http://books.google.com/books?id=TwwQAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Man+is+a+slow%2C+sloppy%2C+and+brilliant+thinker%3B+computers+are+fast%2C+accurate%2C+and+stupid%22#search_anchor here], Pfeiffer's article contained the line &quot;Man is a slow, sloppy, and brilliant thinker; computers are fast, accurate, and stupid.&quot;

* Education is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything he learned in school.
** Einstein did write this quote in &quot;On Education&quot; from 1936, which appeared in ''Out of My Later Years'', but it was not his own original quip, he attributed it to an unnamed &quot;wit&quot;.
** Very popular in French: &quot;''La culture est ce qui reste lorsque l’on a tout oublié''&quot; (Culture is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything). Attributed in French to [[w:Édouard Herriot|Édouard Herriot]] (1872-1957) and, in English, sometimes to [[w:Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset]]. Another French variant is &quot;la culture est ce qui reste lorsqu'on a oublié toutes les choses apprises&quot; (Culture is that which remains if one has forgotten everything one has learned), which appears in the 1912 book ''Propos Critiques'' by [[w:Georges Duhamel|Georges Duhamel]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xpk_AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22la+culture+est+ce+qui+reste+lorsqu%27on+a+oubli%C3%A9+toutes+les+choses+apprises%22#search_anchor p. 14]. And another English variant is &quot;Culture is that which remains with a man when he has forgotten all he has learned&quot; which appears in ''The Living Age: Volume 335'' from 1929, [http://books.google.com/books?id=tHFRAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Culture+is+that+which+remains+with+a+man+when+he+has+forgotten+all+he+has+learned%22#search_anchor p. 159], where it is attributed to &quot;Edouard Herriot, French Minister of Education&quot;. Another English variant is &quot;Education is that which remains behind when all we have learned at school is forgotten&quot;, which appears in ''The Education Outlook, vol. 60'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=dNcgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA532#v=onepage&amp;q=%22education%20is%20that%20which%20remains%22&amp;f=false p. 532] (from an issue dated 2 December 1907), where it is attributed to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].
** The saying is found in an 1891 article by Swedish writer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Key Ellen Key], &quot;Själamorden i skolorna&quot;, which was published in the journal &quot;Verdandi&quot;, no. 2, pages 86-98 (the saying is on p. 97). The same article was republished later as a chapter in her 1900 book &quot;Barnets Århundrade&quot;. Here is the quote in Swedish ([https://archive.org/stream/barnetsrhundrade02ellenkey#page/n167/mode/2up p. 160]): Men bildning är lyckligtvis icke blott kunskap om fakta, utan enligt en ypperlig paradox: »det, som är kvar, sedan vi glömt allt, vad vi lärt». Here it is from the 1909 English translation of the book ([https://archive.org/stream/centurychild00frangoog#page/n246/mode/2up p. 231]): &quot;But education happily is not simply the knowledge of facts, it is, as an admirable paradox has put it, what is left over after we have forgotten all we have learnt.&quot; From the way Ellen Key puts it, she doesn’t take credit for the saying, but rather refers to it as an already known “paradox” that she explicitly puts between quotation marks.

* If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth, man would have no more than four years to live. No more bees, no more pollination … no more men!
** A variant — &quot;Professor Einstein, the learned scientist, once calculated that if all bees disappeared off the earth, four years later all humans would also have disappeared&quot; — appears in ''The Irish Beekeeper'', v.19-20, 1965-66, p74, citing ''Abeilles et Fleurs'' (''Bees and Flowers'', the house magazine of Union Nationale de l'Apiculture Française) for June 1965. Snopes.com mentions its use in a beekeepers' protest in 1994 in Europe [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/bees.asp] suggesting invention and attribution to Einstein for political reasons.

* The most important decision we can make is whether this is a friendly or hostile universe. From that one decision all others spring.
** Multiple variations of this quote can be found, but the earliest one on Google Books which uses the phrase &quot;friendly or hostile&quot; and attributes it to Einstein is ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Spiritual Healing'' by Susan Gregg (2000), [http://books.google.com/books?id=XLQ8X67PozAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5], and this book gives no source for the quote.
**A variant is found in Irving Oyle's ''The New American Medicine Show'' (1979) on p. 163, where Oyle writes: 'There is a story about Albert Einstein's view of human existence. Asked to pose the most vital question facing humanity, he replied, &quot;Is the universe friendly?&quot;' This variant is repeated in a number of books from the 1980s and 90s, so it probably pre-dates the &quot;friendly or hostile&quot; version. And the idea that the most important question we can ask is &quot;Is the universe friendly?&quot; dates back much earlier than the attribution to Einstein, for example in Emil Carl Wilm's 1912 book ''The Problem of Religion'' he includes the following footnote on [http://books.google.com/books?id=nWYiAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 114]: 'A friend proposed to the late [[Frederic William Henry Myers|F. W. H. Myers]] the following question: &quot;What is the thing which above all others you would like to know? If you could ask the Sphinx one question, and only one, what would the question be?&quot; After a moment's silence Myers replied: &quot;I think it would be this: Is the universe friendly?&quot;'

* The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
** Variously attributed also to [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Mark Twain]]. The earliest known occurrence, and probable origin, is from a 1981 text from [[Narcotics Anonymous]]: &quot;Insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results.&quot; Cf. [[Rita Mae Brown#Misattributed]].

* Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening at once.
** It seems that this quote has only begun to be attributed to Einstein recently, the earliest published source located being the 2008 book ''Visualization for Dummies'' by Bernard Golden, [http://books.google.com/books?id=2ppZkdmpSlgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 85]. Before that it was often attributed to the physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], who quoted the saying in ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=mdjsOeTgatsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 10]. In fact, this quip is much older; the earliest source located is [[w:Ray Cummings|Ray Cummings]]' 1921 short story &quot;The Time Professor&quot;, which [https://books.google.com/books?id=sXpDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA371#v=onepage&amp;q=%22time%20is%20what%20keeps%20everything%20from%20happening%20at%20once%22&amp;f=false includes the passage]:  '&quot;I ''do'' know what time is,&quot; Tubby declared.  He paused.  &quot;Time,&quot; he added slowly -- &quot;time is what keeps everything from happening at once ...&quot;.'  Cummings repeated the quote in his 1922 science fiction novel ''The Girl in the Golden Atom'', available on Project Gutenberg [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21094 here] (according to ''Science-Fiction: The Early Years'' by Everett F. Bleiler, [http://books.google.com/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 171], the novel was a composite of two earlier stories published in 1919 and 1920). [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21094/21094-h/21094-h.htm#CHAPTER_V Chapter V] contains the following paragraph: ''The Big Business Man smiled. &quot;Time,&quot; he said, &quot;is what keeps everything from happening at once.&quot;'' The next-earliest source found for this quote is another book by Ray Cummings, [http://books.google.com/books?id=YdZEAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22everything+from+happening+at+once%22#search_anchor ''The Man Who Mastered Time''] from 1929, and no published examples of the quote from authors other than Cummings can be found until the 1962 ''Film Facts: Volume 5'' where it appears on [http://books.google.com/books?id=sr0vAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22everything+from+happening+at+once%22#search_anchor p. 48]. So, it seems likely that Ray Cummings is the real originator of this saying.

* Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.
** From William Bruce Cameron's ''Informal Sociology: A Casual Introduction to Sociological Thinking'' (1963), p. 13. The comment is part of a longer paragraph and does not appear in quotations in Cameron's book, and [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22not%20everything%20that%20can%20be%20counted%20counts%22%20cameron&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp other sources] such as [http://books.google.com/books?id=KMsB1GE8dBEC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Not%20everything%20that%20can%20be%20counted%20counts%22&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Not%20everything%20that%20can%20be%20counted%20counts%22&amp;f=false The Student's Companion to Sociology (p. 92)] attribute the quote to Cameron. A [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=%22not+everything+that+can+be+counted%22+einstein+princeton&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N number of recent books] claim that Einstein had a sign with these words in his office in Princeton, but until a reliable historical source can be found to support this, skepticism is warranted. The earliest source on Google Books that mentions the quote in association with Einstein and Princeton is Charles A. Garfield's 1986 book ''Peak Performers: The New Heroes of American Business,'' in which he wrote on p. 156:
**: Albert Einstein liked to underscore the micro/macro partnership with a remark from Sir George Pickering that he chalked on the blackboard in his office at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton: &quot;Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.&quot;

* If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker.
** According to ''The Quote Verifier'' (2006) by Ralph Keyes, Einstein never said any such thing. (According to p. 285 of the book's &quot;source notes&quot; Keyes checked ''New Statesman'' 16 April 1965, which is commonly cited as the source of this quote. Some other books claim it is from ''New Statesman'' 16 April 1955 and at least one has it as 1945, but a [http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search?num=10&amp;q=einstein+watchmaker+%22new+statesman%22 Google Books search] with the date range restricted to 1900-1995 shows that all the earliest sources give it as 1965. This includes the earliest source located, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations'' from 1971, as can be verified by [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22of+his+making+the+atom+bomb+possible.+quoted+in+new+statesman%2C+16+april+1965%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 this search].) Keyes notes that Einstein &quot;did use similar words to make a very different point&quot; when he wrote, in a 1954 letter to the editor at ''The Reporter'' magazine, &quot;If I would be a young man again and had to decide how to make my living, I would not try to become a scientist or scholar or teacher. I would rather choose to be a plumber or a peddler in the hope to find that modest degree of independence still available under present circumstances.&quot;
** Similarly, in ''Einstein and the Poet'' by William Hermanns, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 86], Einstein is quoted saying the following in a 1948 interview: &quot;If I should be born again, I will become a cobbler and do my thinking in peace.&quot;

* If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.
** The earliest published attribution of this quote to Einstein found on Google Books is the 1991 book ''The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis'' by Raj Jain (p. 507), but no source to Einstein's original writings is given and the quote itself is older; for example ''New Guard: Volume 5, Issue 3'' from 1961 says on [http://books.google.com/books?id=5BbZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22fit+the+theory%22#search_anchor p. 312] &quot;Someone once said that if the facts do not fit the theory, then the facts must be changed&quot;, while ''Product engineering: Volume 29, Issues 9-12'' from 1958 gives the slight variant on p. 9 &quot;There is an age-old adage, 'If the facts don't fit the theory, change the theory.' But too often it's easier to keep the theory and change the facts.&quot; These quotes are themselves probably variants of an even earlier saying which used the phrasing &quot;so much the worse for the facts&quot;, many examples of which can be seen in [http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=facts+fit+%22so+much+the+worse+for+the+facts%22&amp;tbs=,cdr:1,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201950&amp;num=10 this search]; for example, the 1851 ''American Whig Review, Volumes 13-14'' says on [http://books.google.com/books?id=910CAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA488#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 488] &quot;However, Mr. Newhall may possibly have been of that casuist's opinion, who, when told that the facts of the matter did not bear out his hypothesis, said 'So much the worse for the facts.'&quot; The German idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte circa 1800 did say &quot;If theory conflicts with the facts, so much the worse for the facts.&quot; The Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs in his &quot;Tactics and Ethics&quot; (1923) echoed the same quotation.

* The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.
** Commonly quoted on the internet, and also in recent books such as ''Planetary Survival Manual'' by Matthew Stein (2000), p. 51.
** Stein's book is the earliest published source located with that precise version of the quote, but the quote can be found in earlier [[w:Usenet|Usenet]] posts such as [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.ascii/msg/d9f6ec3887950a0d?hl=en this one from 1995], and other published variants of the quote using the words &quot;sacred gift&quot; can be found earlier. A [http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search?q=%22sacred+gift%22+einstein Google Books search] with the date range restricted to 1900-1990 shows only a handful in the 1980s and 1970s, and several of them attribute it to ''The Metaphoric Mind'' by Bob Samples (1976), which also seems to be the earliest published variant. Samples does not provide an exact quote, but writes on p. 26: &quot;Albert Einstein called the intuitive or metaphoric mind a sacred gift. He added that the rational mind was a faithful servant. It is paradoxical that in the context of modern life we have begun to worship the servant and defile the divine.&quot; It seems as if the last sentence about worshipping the servant is just Samples' own comment (though in later variants it became part of the supposed quote), while the earlier sentences only paraphrase something that Samples claims Einstein to have said. Einstein had many quotes about the value of intuition and imagination, but the specific word &quot;gift&quot; can be found in a comment remembered by János Plesch in the section [[Albert_Einstein#Attributed_from_memory_and_posthumous_publications|Attributed in posthumous publications]], &quot;When I examine myself and my methods of thought I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.&quot; So, Bob Samples might have been paraphrasing that comment. Likewise Einstein had a number of quotes about the intellect being secondary to intuition, but the language of the intellect &quot;serving&quot; can be found in a quote from the [[Albert_Einstein#Out_of_My_Later_Years_.281950.29|Out of My Later Years (1950)]] section, &quot;And certainly we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. It cannot lead, it can only serve; and it is not fastidious in its choice of a leader.&quot;

* Nuclear power is a hell of a way to boil water.
** Commonly quoted on the internet, this quote is actually from Karl Grossman, via his 1980 book ''Cover Up: What You are Not Supposed to Know About Nuclear Power'' (p. 155; freely available online via its [http://www.thepermanentpress.com/p-354-cover-up.aspx publisher]; see PDF page 187).

* Information is not knowledge. The only source of knowledge is experience.
** According to Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, this is not one of Einstein's identifiable quotations. (Source: [http://www.paralegalpie.com/paralegalpie/2009/11/did-anybody-really-say-that.html paralegalpie.com].)
** The phrase &quot;the only source of knowledge is experience&quot; is found in an English-language essay from 1896:  &quot;We can only be guided by what we know, and our only source of knowledge is experience&quot; (Arthur J. Pillsbury, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mw9IAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA595&amp;dq=%22only+source&quot; &quot;The Final Word&quot;], ''Overland Monthly'', November 1896).  The thought can be seen as a paraphrase of John Locke's argument from his ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'':  &quot;Whence has it [the Mind] all the materials of Reason and Knowledge?  To this I answer, in one Word, From ''Experience''&quot;. (Locke, [[s:An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Book II/Chapter I|An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Book II/Chapter I, 2]].)

* These days it is common knowledge that '''short waves are more powerful than long ones''', as the very short ones, known as x-rays, damage living tissues. It took half-a-century to learn this fact: '''it was one of the great discoveries of young Albert Einstein of 1905. When he announced it leading researchers found it most incredible'''...

* ...do not be impressed by the imprint of a famous publishing house or the volumes of an author's publications. Bear in mind that [[Einstein]] needed only seventeen pages for his contribution which revolutionized physics, while there are [[w:Graphomania|graphomanics]] in asylums who use up mounds of paper every day.
** [[Stanislav Andreski]], ''The Social Sciences as Sorcery'' (1972, London: Deutsch), p 86

* The astonishing thing about Einstein's equations is that they appear to have come out of nothing.

* '''I was particularly won over by his sweet disposition, by his general kindness, by his [[simplicity]], and by his friendliness.''' Occasionally, gaiety would gain the upper hand and he would strike a more personal note and even disclose some detail of his day-to-day life. Then again, reverting to his characteristic mood of reflection and meditation, he would launch into a profound and original discussion of a variety of scientific and other problems. I shall always remember the enchantment of all those meetings, from which I carried away an indelible impression of Einstein's great human qualities.
** [[Louis de Broglie]], ''New Perspectives in Physics'', p. 182

* It is almost impertinent to talk of the ascent of man in the presence of two men, Newton and Einstein, who stride like gods. Of the two, Newton is the Old Testament god; it is Einstein who is the New Testament figure. He was full of humanity, pity, a sense of enormous sympathy. His vision of nature herself was that of a human being in the presence of something god-like, and that is what he always said about nature. He was fond of talking about God: ‘God does not play at dice’, ‘God is not malicious’. Finally Niels Bohr one day said to him, ‘Stop telling God what to do’. But that is not quite fair. Einstein was a man who could ask immensely simple questions. And what his life showed, and his work, is that when the answers are simple too, then you hear God thinking.
** Jacob Bronowski, ''The Ascent of Man'' (1974), Ch. 7: The Majestic Clockwork

* '''Like many other [[great]] [[scientists]] he does not fit the boxes in which popular polemicists like to pigeonhole him.''' … It is clear for example that he had respect for the religious values enshrined within [[Judaic]] and [[Christian]] traditions … but what he understood by religion was something far more subtle than what is usually meant by the word in popular discussion.

* Some people have reported that Einstein was quite a good musician, but others weren't so enthusiastic. A professional violinist claimed he &quot;fiddled like a lumberjack&quot;; a famous pianist playing with him demanded, &quot;For heaven's sake Albert, can't you count?&quot;; and a music critic in Berlin, thinking Einstein was famous for his violin playing rather than physics, judged that &quot;Einstein's playing is excellent, but he does not deserve world fame; there are many others just as good.&quot;
** Alice Calaprice &amp; Trevor Lipscombe, ''Albert Einstein: A Biography'' (2005)

* To-day, thanks to Einstein, we have definite reasons for believing that ultra-precise observation of nature has revealed our natural geometry arrived at with solids and light rays to be slightly non-Euclidean and to vary from place to place. So although the non-Euclidean geometers never suspected it (with the exception of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]]), our real world happens to be one of the dream-worlds whose possible existence their mathematical genius forsaw.
** A. D'Abro, ''[https://archive.org/details/TheEvolutionOfScientificThought The Evolution of Scientific Thought from Newton to Einstein]'' (1927) p. 37

* His considered answer to what God was doing before creating the universe was &quot;the world was made with time and not in time.&quot; [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] God is a being who transcends time, a being located outside time altogether and responsible for creating time as well as space and matter. ...[[Plato]] said much the same thing hundreds of years earlier. ...The history of philosophy is so rich and diverse that it would be astonishing if theories emerging from science hadn't been foreshadowed in some vague way by somebody. The significant thing about Einstein's work is that he showed in a precise, testable way, using detailed mathematical theory, how space and time are ''part'' of nature, and not merely a given arena in which the great drama of nature is acted out.
** [[w:Paul Davies|Paul Davies]], ''Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life'' (2007)

* [[Richard Feynman|Dick]] fought back against my skepticism, arguing that Einstein had failed because he stopped thinking in concrete physical images and became a manipulator of equations. I had to admit that was true. The great discoveries of Einstein’s earlier years were all based on direct physical intuition. Einstein’s later unified theories failed because they were only sets of equations without physical meaning. Dick’s sum-over-histories theory was in the spirit of the young Einstein, not of the old Einstein. It was solidly rooted in physical reality.
** [[Freeman Dyson]], ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), p. 62.

* Einstein was not a mathematician, but a physicist who had mixed feelings about mathematics. ...[H]e had enormous respect for the power of mathematics to describe the workings of nature, and he had an instinct for mathematical beauty ...On the other hand, he had no interest in pure mathematics, and he had no technical skill as a mathematician. In his later years he hired younger colleagues... assistants to do mathematical calculations for him. His way of thinking was physical rather than mathematical. He was supreme among physicists as a bird who saw further than others.

* '''Like [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], Einstein did his great work up to the age of forty without any reductionist bias.''' His crowning achievement, the general relativistic theory of gravitation, grew out of a deep physical understanding of natural processes. '''Only at the very end of his ten-year struggle to understand gravitation did he reduce the outcome of his understanding to a finite set of field equations.''' But like Hilbert, as he grew older he concentrated his attention more and more on the formal properties of [[w:Einstein field equations|his equations]], and he lost interest in the wider universe of ideas out of which his equations arose. His last twenty years were spent in a fruitless search for a set of equations that would unify the whole of physics, without paying attention to the rapidly proliferating experimental discoveries that any unified theory would have to explain. I do not have to say more about... '''Einstein's lonely attempt to reduce physics to a finite set of marks on paper'''. His attempt '''failed as dismally as Hilbert's attempt to do the same thing in mathematics.'''
** [[Freeman Dyson]], ''The Scientist As Rebel'' (2006)

* Einstein in real life was not only a great politician and a great philosopher. He was also a great observer of the human comedy, with a robust sense of humor. The third side of Einstein’s personality is not emphasized by [Steven] Gimbel, but was an important cause of his immense popularity. He came as an observer to my boarding school in England in 1931, a few years before I arrived there. He was in England as the guest of Frederick Lindemann, an Oxford physicist who was also a friend and adviser to Winston Churchill.&lt;br&gt;Lindemann took him to the school to meet one of the boys who was a family friend. The boy was living in Second Chamber, in an ancient building where the walls are ornamented with marble memorials to boys who occupied the rooms in past centuries. Einstein and Lindemann wandered by mistake into the adjoining First Chamber, which had been converted from a living room to a bathroom. In First Chamber, the marble memorials were preserved, but underneath them on the walls were hooks where boys had hung their smelly football clothes. Einstein surveyed the scene for a while in silence, and then said: “Now I understand: the spirits of the departed pass over into the trousers of the living.”

* The longitude race was reborn in a twentieth-century version, as optimistic inventors designed devices to synchronize timepieces all over the world. Aiming to protect the fortunes they envisaged reaping, they applied for patents in Switzerland, center of the clock-making trade. And many of their designs landed on the desk of a philosophical physicist who was originally more interested in thermodynamics than in time—Patent Officer Albert Einstein.

* I reflected with pleasure on my conversations with the late Hungarian theoretician Nandor Balazs, one of Einstein's last assistants. Balazs did not try to hide Einstein's foibles - including his impatience with pestering journalists and autograph-hunters, his selfish pursuit of what would now be called &quot;his own space&quot; - but he stressed that Einstein was a man of exceptional kindness and generosity. So was he a saint?, I asked Balazs. &quot;No,&quot; he replied firmly. &quot;He was better than that - he was human.&quot;

* We postulate: It shall be impossible, by any experiment whatsoever performed inside such a box, to detect a difference between an acceleration relative to the nebulae and gravity. That is, an accelerating box in some gravitational field is indistinguishable from a stationary box in some different gravitational field. How much like Einstein this sounds, how reminiscent of his postulate of special relativity! We know the principle of equivalence works for springs, (as we knew special relativity worked for electrodynamics), and we extend it by fiat to all experiments whatsoever. We are used to such procedures by now, but how originally brilliant it was in 1911—what a brilliant, marvelous man Einstein was!
** [[Richard Feynman]], 1962-63, in ''Feynman Lectures on Gravitation'' (1995), Lecture 7

* Einstein, who thought that he had a unified theory just around the corner, but didn't know anything about nuclei and was unable of course to guess it.

* '''Einstein was a giant. His head was in the [[clouds]], but his feet were on the ground. Those of us who are not so tall have to [[choose]]!'''
** [[Richard Feynman]], as quoted in ''Collective Electrodynamics : Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism'' (2002) by Carver A. Mead, p. xix

* From 1916 Einstein and [[Willem de Sitter|de Sitter]] corresponded extensively on exactly what kind of universe best fit the relativity equations. De Sitter initially developed a model of a spherical universe, in contrast to the cylindrical one Einstein had envisioned. De Sitter also tried to map out the shape of the spherical universe in absence of all matter. '''Einstein's reaction to de Sitter's model was strong and negative'''...de Sitter's sphere described a universe that changed in size instead of remaining nicely constant. ...Einstein saw matter—and its corresponding gravitational field—as what inherently created the shape of the universe. He cited what he dubbed &quot;[[w:Mach's principle|Mach's principle]],&quot;...the movements of any object ...were determined by all other bodies in the universe. ...how a body moves through space is tantamount to what shape space is, '''the concept of &quot;shape&quot; without matter''', Einstein insisted, '''was meaningless.'''
** Karen C. Fox, Aries Keck, ''Einstein A to Z'' (2004)

* Einstein joked to his dear friend Max Born that he had a version of the Midas touch: everything he said turned to newsprint. Einstein’s science made him a worldwide celebrity, a status others might have enjoyed, but which Einstein despised. He was no shrinking violet, yet he detested the shallowness and meaningless absurdity that came with his universal adoration. But he realised that it could be handy. He was given a cultural megaphone and he decided that its best use was to amplify the concerns of those whose voices were least heard.
** Steven Gimbel, &quot;[http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/12/five-reasons-we-should-celebrate-albert-einstein Five reasons we should celebrate Albert Einstein]&quot;  (12 June 2015)

* Here is a man who changed the way the way we see reality, who stared down hatred and stood up for justice, yet despite all of this, the thing we immediately think of is that mane of unkempt, wild white hair. That may seem shallow of us, but I think it is a good thing. What does Einstein’s hair signify? It was a political statement – he refused to conform to social standards of personal appearance. He was unapologetic in his individuality and unashamed of being different.

* The assignment we were given for this article was to describe the impact of Einstein’s work on 20th-century physics. This formulation of our task is somewhat problematic given that a sizeable fraction of 20th-century physics is Einstein’s work and most of the rest is more or less directly connected to it. Hence Einstein’s impact definitely cannot be treated perturbatively. In fact, it would have been much easier to write about those developments of 20th-century physics that were not connected to the work of Einstein. But who would want to read or write that?

* I always like to remember that Einstein, in his last three decades of life, followed [[w:Unified field theory|this dream]] and seemed to be completely unaware of the exciting developments that were happening in nuclear physics during this time.
** [[w:Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]], interview published in ''Superstrings: A Theory of Everything?'' (1988) edited by Paul C. W. Davies and Julian R. Brown

* In the [[w:Brownian motion#Einstein's theory|Brownian motion paper]], Einstein... calculations involved the relationship between [[w:Osmotic pressure|osmotic pressure]], viscosity, and the way individual particles suspended in the liquid diffuse... He realized that the kick produced by a single molecule hitting a particle as large as a pollen grain could not produce a measurable shift... But the large particle is constantly being bombarded... if you take a very small time interval, then just by chance at that instant the particle will be receiving more kicks on one side. The combined effect will shift the particle by a minute amount... Einstein discovered that it gradually moved farther from its starting point... as a [[w:Random walk|random walk]]. He showed the distance ... depends on the square root of the time... This is called &quot;root mean square&quot; displacement and the equation Einstein worked out for displacement involves the temperature of the liquid, its viscosity, the radius of the particle and [[w:Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]. ...He also realized that if the predicted displacement could be measured... the same equation... could be used to give a value of Avogadro's number. ...It was extremely difficult to make the observations... but in 1908... [[w:Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean-Baptiste Perrin]] finally succeeded. ...Perrin's results exactly matched the predictions from Einstein's theory. ...The whole package finally established the reality of atoms and molecules, and the validity of the [[w:Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]...
** [[w:John Gribbin|John Gribbin]] and Mary Gribbin, ''Annus Mirabilis: 1905, Albert Einstein, and the Theory of Relativity'' (2005)

* '''He used to say the left-hand side of [[w:Einstein field equations|his equation]] is beautiful and the right-hand side is ugly. Much of what he was doing in the latter part of his career was trying to move the right-hand side to the left... and understand matter as a geometrical structure.''' To build matter itself from geometry—that in a sense is what [[w:String theory|string theory]] does. ...especially in a theory like the [[w:Heterotic string theory|heterotic string]] which is inherently a theory of gravity in which the particles of matter as well as the other forces of nature emerge in the same way that gravity emerges from geometry. Einstein would have been pleased with this, at least with the goal, if not the realization.

* If light takes the path with the least time between two points, and light beams bend under the influence of gravity, then the shortest distance between two points is a curved line. Einstein was shocked by this conclusion: If light could be observed traveling in a curved line, it would mean that ''space itself is curved''.
** [[Michio Kaku]], ''Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension'' (1995)

* Einstein independently discovered [[w:Bernhard Riemann|Riemann's]] original program, to give a purely geometric explanation to the concept of &quot;force.&quot; …To Riemann, the bending and warping of space causes the appearance of a force. Thus forces do not really exist; what is actually happening is that space itself is being bent out of shape. The problem with Riemann's approach... was that he had no idea specifically how gravity or electricity and magnetism caused the warping of space. ...Here Einstein succeeded where Riemann failed.
** [[Michio Kaku]], ''Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension'' (1995)

* Einstein showed that the [[w:Luminiferous aether|aether]] was unnecessary. However, he never said that the aether didn't exist. He merely said it was irrelevant. Thus, by [[w:Occam's razor|Occam's razor]], physicists don't refer to the aether any more.
** [[Michio Kaku]], ''Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension'' (1995)

* He discovered a host of other basic results in theoretical physics and it has been pointed out more than once that if somebody asked: &quot;Who is the greatest modern physicist after Einstein?&quot; the answer would be: Einstein again. And why? Because, although the theory of relativity in itself would have established his fame forever, had somebody else discovered relativity, his other discoveries would still make him the second greatest physicist of his time.
** Cornelius Lanczos, ''Albert Einstein and the Cosmic World Order'' (1965)

* The '''mathematical genius can only carry on from the point''' which mathematical knowledge within '''his culture has''' already '''reached'''. Thus if Einstein had been born into a primitive tribe which was unable to count beyond three, life-long application to mathematics probably would not have carried him beyond the development of a decimal system based on fingers and toes.
** [[w:Ralph Linton|Ralph Linton]], ''The Study of Man'' (1936)

* Einstein's supreme greatness was in transforming physical thinking from that of the culmination of classical physics about 1900 to that of quantum mechanics starting about 1925. ...'''far more than anyone else, he caused physicists to think in terms of probabilities. He began to do this in his early work in thermodynamics, and he brought such thinking to its first great fruition in 1905 in his work on [[w:Brownian motion|Brownian movement]] and in his first work on radiation, in which he introduced the concept of light quanta or photons.''' Its second, even greater fruition was in his famous paper on the quantum theory of radiation in 1917.&lt;br /&gt;That paper illustrated methods that have been in use almost without change ever since, even though the majority of the users have no knowledge that it was Einstein who propounded them. It was in this paper that '''Einstein postulated the various transition possibilities between two states of a quantized system. ...quantum theory has existed ever since precisely for the purpose of evaluating these probabilities.''' In this paper of 1917 Einstein postulated in particular the process known as [[w:Stimulated emission|stimulated emission]], and inferred the properties of this process. This is the process employed in the... light [[w:Maser|maser]] or [[w:Laser|laser]].

* There once was a doctor with cool white hair. He was well known because he came up with some important ideas. He didn’t grow the cool hair until after he was done figuring that stuff out, but by the time everyone realized how good his ideas were, he had grown the hair, so that’s how everyone pictures him. He was so good at coming up with ideas that we use his name to mean “someone who’s good at thinking.”&lt;br&gt;Two of his biggest ideas were about how space and time work. This thing you’re reading right now explains those ideas using only the ten hundred words people use the most often. The doctor figured out the first idea while he was working in an office, and he figured out the second one ten years later, while he was working at a school. That second idea was a hundred years ago this year. (He also had a few other ideas that were just as important. People have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how he was so good at thinking.)

* '''Under [[w:Marcel Grossmann|Grossman's]] guidence, Einstein studied and learned [[w:Tensor|tensor]] analysis. The two men actually published several papers together''', but the work at this stage was still a kind of groping in the dark—a mind-tormenting search for the one equation out of hundreds that was the correct one. ...Interestingly, '''the correct equation was actually considered briefly, but rejected''' by Einstein because he came to the mistaken conclusion that it violated [[w:Causality|causality]]. Then a further mistake led to the abandonment of the [[w:Principle of covariance|principle of covariance]].
** Barry Parker, ''Einstein's Dream: The Search for a Unified Theory of the Universe'' (1986)

* Pondering about the problem, Einstein thought about the beam of light curving around the limb of the sun; he soon realized that it was not the beam that was bent, but rather the space through which it traveled. Matter must somehow curve space and other matter must move through this curved space in the way we see it move—yet this way must be &quot;natural.&quot; He decided the most natural way would be along a path that represented the shortest distance between two given points in space (this is called the [[w:Geodesic|geodesic]] in mathematics). This would mean that '''the sun curves the space around it and the planets move in this space along geodesics. These geodesics appear to us to be elliptical orbits, but in curved space they are actually straight lines.'''
** Barry Parker, ''Einstein's Dream: The Search for a Unified Theory of the Universe'' (1986)

* From a simple point of view, then, '''Einstein's equation can be written: [[w:Tensor|tensor]] A = tensor B''', where tensor A describes the curvature of space and tensor B describes the matter that causes the curvature. In practice, B can also contain terms describing an electromagnetic field since electromagnetic fields represent energy, and energy is just another form of mass. Einstein's dissatisfaction centered on tensor B.
** Barry Parker, ''Einstein's Dream: The Search for a Unified Theory of the Universe'' (1986) referring to the [[w:Einstein field equations|Einstein field equations]] of general relativity.

* Summing up, we may say that there is hardly one among the great problems, in which modern physics is so rich, to which Einstein has not made an important contribution. '''That he may sometimes have missed the target in his speculations, as, for example, in his [[w:Photoelectric effect|hypothesis of light quanta]], cannot really be held too much against him''', for it is not possible to introduce fundamentally new ideas, even in the most exact sciences, without occasionally taking risk.

* I cannot really endorse [[Planck]]'s philosophy, even if it is [[logically]] valid and even though I respect the [[human]] [[attitudes]] to which it gives rise. &lt;br /&gt; '''[[Einstein]]'s conception is closer to mine. His [[God]] is somehow involved in the immutable [[laws]] of [[nature]]. '''Einstein has a feeling for the central order of things. He can detect it in the [[simplicity]] of natural laws. We may take it that he felt this simplicity very strongly and directly during his discovery of the theory of relativity. Admittedly, this is a far cry from the contents of religion. I don't believe Einstein is tied to any religious tradition, and '''I rather think the idea of a personal God is entirely foreign to him. But as far as he is concerned there is no split between science and religion: the central order is part of the subjective as well as the objective realm, and this strikes me as being a far better starting point.'''
**[[Wolfgang Pauli]], in statements after the [[w:Solvay Conference| Solvay Conference]] of 1927, as quoted in [http://www.edge.org/conversation/science-and-religion ''Physics and Beyond'' (1971)] by [[Werner Heisenberg]]

* '''Einstein did not consider the concept of 'determinism' to be as fundamental as it is frequently held to be''' (as he told me emphatically several times), and he denied energetically that he had ever put up a postulate such as (your letter, para. 3): 'the sequence of such conditions must also be objective and real, that is, automatic, machine-like, deterministic'. In the same way '''he ''disputes'' that he uses as criterion for the inadmissibility  of a theory the question: 'Is it rigorously deterministic?'&lt;BR /&gt;Einstein's point of departure is 'realistic' rather than 'deterministic,' which means that his philosophical prejudice is a different one'''...
**[[Wolfgang Pauli]], Letter to Max Born (March 31, 1954) as quoted by P.W. Milonni, ''Fast Light, Slow Light and Left-Handed Light'' (2004)

* '''I tried to persuade him to give up his determinism, which amounted to the view that the world was a four-dimensional Parmenidean block [[universe]] in which change was a human illusion, or very nearly so. (He agreed that this had been his view, and while discussing it I called him &quot;[[Parmenides]]&quot;.)''' I argued that if men, or other organisms, could experience change and genuine succession in time, then this was real. It could not be explained away by a theory of the successive rising into our consciousness of time slices which in some sense coexist; for this kind of &quot;rising into consciousness&quot; would have precisely the same character as that succession of changes which the theory tries to explain away. … I tried to present to Einstein-Parmenides as strongly as I could my conviction that a clear stand must be made against any idealistic view of time. And I also tried to show that, though the idealistic view was compatible with both determinism and indeterminism, a clear stand should be made in favor of an &quot;open&quot; universe — one in which the future was in no sense contained in the past or the present, even though they do impose severe restrictions on it. I argued that we should not be swayed by our theories to give up realism (for which the strongest arguments were based on common sense), though I think that he was ready to admit, as I was, that we might be forced one day to give it up if very powerful arguments (of [[Gödel]]'s type, say) were to be brought against it. I therefore argued that with regard to time, and also to indeterminism (that is, the incompleteness of physics), the situation was precisely similar to the situation with regard to realism. Appealing to his own way of expressing things in theological terms, I said: if [[God]] had wanted to put everything into the world from the beginning, He would have created a universe without change, without organisms and evolution, and without man and man's experience of change. '''But He seems to have thought that a live universe with events unexpected even by Himself would be more interesting than a dead one.'''
** [[Karl Popper]], in [http://books.google.com/books?id=CxND59gFftMC&amp;pg=PA148 ''Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography'', p. 148]

* Einstein had a rare ability to recognize the core principles that account for the world we observe. His perceptions were never diverted by the many fascinating distractions that enshroud Nature’s underlying reality. Common sense, often a source of comfort, can distract. Experimental data, always the ultimate authority, can distract. Einstein saw beyond common sense and, while he respected experimental data, he was not its slave. He saw Nature as it is.
** John S. Rigden, ''Einstein 1905 : The Standard of Greatness'' (2005), Prologue: The Standard of Greatness: Why Einstein?

* In the last twenty years of his life, Einstein’s continued challenging of [[quantum theory]] was often dismissed as his being out of touch with modern physics. He was indeed wrong in denying the reality of the “spooky action” he discovered to lurk in quantum theory. Its existence, now called “entanglement,” has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, Einstein is today recognized as the theory’s most prescient critic. His constant claim that the theory’s weirdness must not be brushed aside is borne out by today’s proliferation of wild interpretations of quantum theory.

[[Newton]] also made a universe, which has lasted 300 years. Einstein has made a universe, and I can't tell you how long that will last.
** [[George Bernard Shaw]], in a speech in honour of Einstein at the Savoy Hotel in London (28 October 1930)

* This man is not challenging the fact of science; he is challenging the action [or axioms] of science. Not only is he challenging the action of science, but the action of science has surrendered to his challenge.

* It is true that many mathematicians and physicists do their best work when young. But in Einstein’s later work we see something much more extreme than the usual falling off. It is as if Thelonious Monk or John Coltrane turned into an obscure twelve-tone composer. How did the greatest physicist since Newton turn into a failed player of mathematical games? All the biographers ask this question; none gives an answer that seems remotely plausible to me as a working scientist.

* In politics, it seems that Einstein was called naive for thoughts that we now understand to have been ahead of his time. Could the same have been true of his later science?&lt;br&gt;For science, the question to be answered is the paradox of Einstein’s failed last years. I would suggest that the resolution of the paradox is that Einstein’s dissent from quantum mechanics and immersion in the search for a unified field theory were not failures but anticipations. After all, even if many string theorists would disagree with Einstein about the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, much of what goes on in string theory these days looks a lot like what Einstein was doing in his Princeton years, which was trying to find new mathematics that might extend general relativity to a unification of all the forces and particles in nature.

* '''The one man who was, during the last years, certainly by far Einstein's best [[friend]], and in some ways strangely resembled him most, was [[Kurt Gödel]], The great logician.'''

* Einstein's theory of relativity has advanced our ideas of the structure of the cosmos a step further. '''It is as if a wall which separated us from Truth has collapsed.''' Wider expanses and greater depths are now exposed to the searching eye of knowledge, regions of which we had not even a presentiment. It has brought us much nearer to grasping the plan that underlies all physical happening.

'''Riemann... clearly left the real development of his ideas in the hands of some subsequent scientist whose genius as a physicist could rise to equal flights with his own as a mathematician.''' After a lapse of seventy years this mission has been fulfilled by Einstein.

* His [[work]] revolved around three rules which apply to all [[science]], our [[problems]], and times:
*:1. Out of clutter, find [[simplicity]];
*:2. From [[discord]] make [[harmony]]; and finally
*:3. In the middle of difficulty lies [[opportunity]].
** [[John Archibald Wheeler]], interviewed in [http://www.bigear.org/vol1no4/wheeler.htm ''Cosmic Search'', Vol. 1, No. 4] ([http://books.google.com/books?id=4IMgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22out+of+clutter%22#search_anchor Fall 1979]). The three principles are sometimes attributed to Einstein himself, but no source can be found showing that Einstein stated them, and Wheeler didn't indicate in the interview whether he was quoting something Einstein had told him or giving his own description of how Einstein worked.

* In considering the structure of the universe... Einstein assumed... the irregularities in the distribution of matter can be neglected [i.e., the universe is homogeneous]. ...he noted that the largest velocities then assigned to the stars and nebulae were very small compared with the velocity of light. In 1917... the immense red-shifts of the farther nebulae were unknown. Einstein, therefore, considered a model of the universe in which matter was distributed in a uniform and continuous manner, the relative motion of the various parts being negligible [i.e., a static universe]. Following [[w:Hugo von Seeliger|Seeliger]], he found it impossible to regard the system as filling the whole of [infinite] Euclidean space. Also he could not regard the universe as an island in infinite space. For, in applying a well-known theorem of [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] relating the densities at various points of space in which a distribution of particles is moving at random, he showed that zero density at the boundary would necessitate zero density at all points inside.&lt;br /&gt;Thus it appeared to Einstein that the universe as a whole could be neither infinite nor have a finite boundary. Hence space as a whole could not be Euclidean. ...In the classical picture time and space are distinct, time being infinite in duration and space Euclidean. In devising an alternative model Einstein retained this world-wide separation of time and space, despite the fusion of the two concepts in General Relativity, but he assumed that space as a whole was of the type known as spherical.&lt;!--p.77--&gt;
** [[Gerald James Whitrow]], ''The Structure of the Universe: An Introduction to Cosmology'' (1949)

* Owing to departures from strict homogeneity, the actual world cannot be ''exactly'' of Einstein's form. The instability of Einstein's universe indicates that in general, a system which is nearly, but not exactly, of this form will tend to depart further and further from it with lapse of time. Consequently, Einstein's model cannot permanently represent the smoothed-out universe of nebulae. It is possible, or course, that the actual universe was much closer to this model in the remote past than it is now. ...It has even been suggested that the Einstein configuration was an unstable equilibrium state through which the universe slowly passed in expanding from an initial 'explosive' phase of small volume and high density.
** [[Gerald James Whitrow]], ''The Structure of the Universe: An Introduction to Cosmology'' (1949)

* Einstein was a world-famous genius and people I knew used to remark, &quot;You spend a good deal of time with Einstein. He has a perfect brain, doesn't he?&quot; Well, I have never known what is meant by a &quot;perfect brain.&quot; I do know that Einstein's mind was very human and had many defects. Einstein was far slower than Jancsi von Neumann to derive mathematical identities. His memory could be faulty, at least after 1933. And he was hardly interested in the details of physics. For a man like Edward Teller, developing the details of a physics problem was passionately important. For Einstein, it was not. In all spheres of life, Einstein's greatest pleasure was in finding, and later expressing, basic principles.&lt;br&gt;But Einstein's understanding was deeper than even Jancsi von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement. Einstein took an extraordinary plea sure in invention. Two of his greatest inventions are the Special and General Theories of Relativity; and for all of Jancsi's brilliance, he never produced anything so original. No modern physicist has.
** [[Eugene Wigner]], ''The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner'' (1992), Ch. 10. It Is Far Better to Have a Good Marriage Than a Quarrel

* A clear pattern emerges... he latches on to some perceived fundamental weakness or contradiction in existing physical theory and worries over it for long periods of time—as long as it takes. '''He is concerned not to exploit existing ideas but to transcend them. This restless style is not necessarily a recipe for success.''' Einstein did not play a creative role in the development of physics after 1925... The basic difficulty was that Einstein believed he saw difficulties in the basic foundations of quantum theory and that, characteristically, he wished to overhaul the theory rather than to exploit it. While his colleagues were applying quantum theory with great success to elucidate the workings of atoms, nuclei, and bulk matter, Einstein held aloof.
** [[Frank Wilczek]] &amp; [[w:Betsy Devine|Betsy Devine]], ''Longing for the Harmonies: Themes and Variations from Modern Physics'' (1987)

* Most scientists are happiest when they are making clear progress, solving some perhaps small but well-defined and significant problems by clever adaptations of known techniques. '''Most people'''—perhaps all—'''feel acutely anxious and unhappy when they are &quot;groping in the dark&quot; or find themselves poised uneasily upon &quot;no firm foundation.&quot; We must admire the courage of those rare individuals who, like Einstein, systematically seek out such situations.'''
** [[Frank Wilczek]] &amp; [[w:Betsy Devine|Betsy Devine]], ''Longing for the Harmonies: Themes and Variations from Modern Physics'' (1987)

* It is quite easy to include a weight for empty space in the equations of gravity. Einstein did so in 1917, introducing what came to be known as the [[w:Cosmological constant|cosmological constant]] into his equations. His motivation was to construct a [[w:Static universe|static model of the universe]]. To achieve this, he had to introduce a [[w:Vacuum_energy#Implications|negative mass density for empty space]], which just canceled the average positive density due to matter. With zero total density, gravitational forces can be in static equilibrium. [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble's]] subsequent discovery of the [[w:Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]], of course, made Einstein's static model universe obsolete. ...'''The fact is that to this day we do not understand in a deep way why''' the vacuum doesn't weigh, or (to say the same thing in another way) why the cosmological constant vanishes, or (to say it in yet another way) why '''Einstein's greatest blunder was a mistake.'''
** [[Frank Wilczek]] &amp; [[w:Betsy Devine|Betsy Devine]], ''Longing for the Harmonies: Themes and Variations from Modern Physics'' (1987)

* So, from a Bayesian perspective, what Einstein did is still induction, and still covered by the notion of a simple prior (Occam prior) that gets updated by new evidence.  It's just the prior was over the possible characters of physical law, and observing other physical laws let Einstein update his model of the character of physical law, which he then used to predict a particular law of gravitation.&lt;br&gt;If you didn't have the concept of a &quot;character of physical law&quot;, what Einstein did would look like magic—plucking the correct model of gravitation out of the space of all possible equations, with vastly insufficient evidence.  But Einstein, by looking at other laws, cut down the space of possibilities for the next law.  He learned the alphabet in which physics was written, constraints to govern his answer.  Not magic, but reasoning on a higher level, across a wider domain, than what a naive reasoner might conceive to be the &quot;model space&quot; of only this one law.&lt;br&gt;So from a probability-theoretic standpoint, Einstein was still data-driven—he just used the data he already had, more effectively.  Compared to any alternate Earths that demanded huge quantities of additional data from astronomical observations and clocks on airplanes to hit them over the head with General Relativity.

* The Layman was sitting in his thatched cottage one day studying the sūtras. &quot;Difficult, difficult,&quot; he said; &quot;like trying to scatter ten measures of sesame seed all over a tree.&quot; &quot;Easy, easy,&quot; Mrs. Pang said; &quot;like touching your feet to the ground when you get out of bed.&quot; &quot;Neither difficult nor easy,&quot; Ling Zhao said; &quot;on the hundred grass tips, the great Masters' meaning.&quot;
